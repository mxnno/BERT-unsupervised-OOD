1016	Four pixel resolutions are supported: 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit, and 24 bit    pixels.
1017	These images were intended for use on DOS (IBM, or Little-Endian) systems.
1018	By convention, DIB images end in the extension ".BMP".
1019	Consequently you    will sometimes hear DIB files referred to as "BMP" files.

1023	March 15, 1991    - 3 -    DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FLAVORS    The DOS DIB images consist of: 1.
1024	A "BITMAPFILEHEADER" file header which identifies the file as  a     DIB  file.
1025	Thisheaderalso gives the total size of the image     file, and the offset to the image data.
1026	A "BITMAPINFOHEADER"  image  header  which specifies  the image     attributes.
1027	An optional palette of colors used by the image.
1028	If  it  exists,     this  may contain 2, 16, or 256 entries.
1029	Each entry is a Windows     RGBQUAD structure.
1030	The image data itself.
1031	The OS/2 DIB images consist of: 1.
1032	The same "BITMAPFILEHEADER" file header which identifies the file     as a  DIB file.
1033	This  header also gives the total size of the     image file, and the offset to the image data.
1034	A "BITMAPCOREHEADER"  image  header  which specifies  the image     attributes.
1035	An optional palette of colors used by the image.
1036	Again, if  this     exists  it may  contain  2, 16, or 256 entries.
1037	Each entry is a     Windows RGBTRIPLE structure.
1038	The image data itself.
1039	The Old Style image bitmap consists of: 1.
1040	Either a BITMAPINFOHEADER or a  BITMAPCOREHEADER.
1041	Whichheader     type is determined by the first long integer (DWORD) value.
1042	An optional color palette.
1043	The image data itself.
1044	CREATING DIB IMAGE FILES.
1045	Creating a DOS DIB image file consists of several straight forwardsteps.
1046	The headers need to be created and then written to the file.
1047	These header    structures are defined in the MS  Windows/3.0  "windows.h"include file.
1048	Palette  information  needs to  be stored for images that are not 24-bit    images.
1049	The five general steps are: 1.
1050	If the image is a 1-bit, 4-bit, or an 8-bit image, creating  the     color palette of RGBQUADS.
1051	Thisserves    toidentify  the  file  as a  DIB image file.
1052	The "bfSize" field is the total size of the file.
1053	Otherwise, this field needs to be filled in    later.
1054	Both the "bfReserved1" and the "bfReserved2"  fields  are  always  set  to    zero.
1055	This works out because the image data  is  written    write after the color palette if one exists.
1056	The "biWidth" field is the width of the image in image pixels.
1057	The "biHeight" field is the height of the image in image lines.
1058	The "biPlanes" field should always be set to 1.
1059	This data is written  out    as if there was one color plane.
1060	The "biBitCount" field is the bit-depth of the image.
1061	This must be either    1, 4, 8, or 24, depending on the bit-depth of the image data.
1062	The "biCompression" field tells how the image data is compressed if it  is    compressed.
1063	DIBimagessupport two  forms  of run-length  encoding.
1064	However, I have never seen any images which use it, and don't know yet how    it works.
1065	Set this field to zero (long zero, or 0L), to indicate that the    data is not compressed.
1066	All subsequent fields of the BITMAPINFOHEADER  structure  may  be  set  to    zero.
1067	The field which you might want to explicitly specify might be "biClrUsed".
1068	Generally,  set    this field to zero.
1069	IMAGE DATA    There are three surprises about the ordering of image datain  DIB image    file.
1070	The creator  of  this  format  was determined to be creative, and    certainly was.
1071	Within the image data, each line written out is padded to  the  next  four    byte  quantity.
1072	For 1-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit images, information is writtenas  you would    expect.
1073	One  bitimagesare  padded  eight pixels to a byte.
1074	Four bit    images are padded two pixels to a byte.
1075	Eight bit images are written  one    pixel per byte.
1076	Twenty-four bit images are written three bytes per pixel.

1407	I've never quite understoodthe trinity thing.
1408	On the one hand, Jesus is supposed to be God incarnate.
1409	First question is, if Jesus was God in human form, how couldhe really be God's son?
1410	While a son might inherit alot of the father's qualities, he is not the father.
1411	They are still two separite entities.
1412	To tryand say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong.
1413	In thatcase, Jesus and God aren't the same.
1414	He's just Godmanifesting himself as Jesus.
1415	At least, this is how I'm seeing it.
1416	Can someonewho is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us?
1417	Getting back to the original question, what is the great price that Jesus paidto redeem our sins?
1418	Was it dying on the cross?
1419	His earthly bodymay have been killed, but then, so what?
1420	Jesus being the onlyone was simply a matter of choice.
1421	I suspect that these questions will be veryoffensive to many Christians on this net.
1422	To those people, please accept mysincere apologies.
1423	(In thisgroup, it's dangerous to say that no one believes something.)
1424	I consider thatterrible heresy, though some people react less violently.
1425	The VirginBirth says that Jesus' birth is God's responsibility.
1426	But it doesn'timply that God's sperm was involved.
1427	In aTrinitarian context, the term Son refers to the eternal Logos, who isa part of God.
1428	The Son didn't come into existence with Jesus' birth.Jesus is the incarnation of the Son.
1429	So his sonness isn'tspecifically a result of being incarnated.
1430	Rather, it's the Sonwho was incarnated.--clh]

2523	It was invented to avoid"contact with the usual Greek terminology" (108).
2524	It was meaningless tonative-speaking Greeks (108).
2525	It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, heaffirms (109).
2526	This is Scrogg's interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.
2527	Even "seriousminded pagan authors" condemned this form of pederasty.
2528	The form andfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.
2529	Anyrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usuallynonexistent.
2530	He concludes that Paul "does not care about any specific item inthe lists" (104).
2531	REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAID.
2532	Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell'sview is that by David Wright.
2533	The LXX must mean "a male who sleeps witha male," making arseno- the object.
2534	Boswell fails to citeHippolytus (Refut.
2535	5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and theSyriac writer Bardensanes.
2536	The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical tothe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34).
2537	Clement of Alexandria in Protr.
2538	The last in particular bears the idea ofhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.
2539	Boswell's treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright's attention(141-44).
2540	Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom's infrequent use of the term.
2541	Wrightobserves that Boswell has "signally failed to demonstrate any us ofarsenokoites etc.
2542	in which it patently does not denote male homosexualactivity" (144).
2543	Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Timand I Cor.
2544	None of these primary versions supports Boswell's limitedconclusion based on them.
2545	This paralleled the increased concern on thepart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.

2547	After that, weget into the "good" stuff of historical & linguistic studies.
2548	THis willinclude "Symposium" by Plato.
2549	Independently we came to the same conclusion.
2550	Apparently the connection ismade in E.A.

2552	But this is doubtful.
2553	SBLASP17 (1979):205-12.
2554	Wright, "Homosexuals or Prostitutes?
2555	He finds the meaning to be general, "a male who has sex with a male" (4-11).
2556	Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former?"
2557	Paul shows a"remarkable originality" in extending the OT ethic to the church (300).

2751	Anyoneout there know if this is why?
2752	Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day standoff ensued.
2753	He engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency.
2754	I was informed of the plan to end the siege.
2755	I discussed it with Attorney General Reno.
2756	I asked the questions I thought it was appropriate for me to ask.
2757	Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.
2758	He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued.
2759	Now we must review the past with an eye towards the future.
2760	I expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review.
2761	If one will go first and then the other.
2762	And it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.
2763	There were no shots coming back from the government side.
2764	I asked a number of questions.
2765	The first question I asked is, why now?
2766	We have waited seven weeks; why now?
2767	They might be needed in other parts of the country.
2768	So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.
2769	The third question I asked was, has the military been consulted?
2770	And so I asked if the military had been consulted.
2771	And I stand by that today.
2772	Q  Mr. President --          THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.
2773	THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.
2774	It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold.
2775	I talked to her yesterday.
2776	I will say this, however.
2777	These people killed four federal officials in the line of duty.
2778	They were heavily armed.
2779	They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly, and they were never fired back on.
2780	We did everything we could to avoid the loss of life.
2781	They made the decision to immolate themselves.
2782	And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the children.
2783	And she said, it's because of the children.
2784	I have to take their word for that.
2785	So that is where I think things stand.
2786	And if you had it to do over again, would you really decide that way?
2787	THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume is just exactly what I announced today.
2788	This is a -- the FBI has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time.
2789	We want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way.
2790	Is there something else we should have known?
2791	Is there some other question they should have asked?
2792	Is there some other question I should have asked?
2793	There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world.
2794	And we may have to confront it again.
2795	THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all along the way.
2796	There were lots of other options pursued.
2797	If you go back -- you all covered it very well.
2798	The FBI -- you did a very good job of it.
2799	Some of the children got out, some of the other people left.
2800	And then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward.
2801	That's what they thought.
2802	Q  Did the government know that the children did not have gas masks?
2803	Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are you in agreement with that?
2804	THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.
2805	They can do whatever they want.
2806	There is nothing to hide here.
2807	This was probably the most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the country.
2808	Q  There are two questions I want to ask you.
2809	MS. MYERS:  Last question.
2810	That was the judgment they made.
2811	Whether they were right or wrong, of course, we will never know.
2812	What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the building burning?
2813	That's the first thing I wanted to know.
2814	Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a Janet Reno decision?
2815	Isn't it, in the end, your decision?
2816	I didn't go over every strategic part of it.
2817	It is a decision for which I take responsibility.
2818	When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had elapsed.
2819	She might have made a decision to change her mind.
2820	I said, if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you.
2821	And I do support her.
2822	She is not ultimately responsible to the American people; I am.
2823	What are your thoughts on it?

3507	Kuwait was in existence since 1752.
3508	That is when Iraq became a state, after Kuwait itself.''
3509	Kuwait's name is derived from al-Kut which means fortress.
3510	Kuwait is also called Qurain, which is the diminutive of qarn, a horn or hill.
3511	Kuwait town flourished and grew since its establishment.
3512	The 'Utub, al-Sabah family is a branch of 'Utub, settled in Kuwait during the early 18th century.
3513	They lived under the protection of Bani Khalid until 1752.
3514	After that, they became independent and Sabah Bin Jabir was chosen as the first ruler for 'Utub.
3515	Carsten Niebuhr (1733-1815) a Dutch explorer was among the first who wrote about the Arabia.
3516	Al-Sabah ('Utub) kept good relations with other powers in the eastern Arabia.
3517	``In the second half of the 18th century, there was no Ottoman ruler in Eastern Arabia.
3518	In fact, Ottoman rule was not even nominally acknowledged.
3519	(p.183) Kuwait had its own identity through the Ottoman domination on the Arab world.
3520	[ From the above text, we can see that Kuwait was not part of the Ottomans or the British colonies.
3521	``Scarcely had we entered it,'' says Pelly, ``when Sheikh Sabah himself came.''
3522	The Sheikh himself would submit to the Cazee's decision.''
3523	Punishment was rarely inflicted.

3738	Eitherway McConkie is wrong.
3739	The second "Lord" is the Hebrew word "Adon"(singular for "Adonai," meaning master or lord).
3740	Obviously the Father is "Jehovah" in this Psalm,and His Son is "Adon."
3741	Another example involves Isa.
3742	Another example involves Ps.
3743	If he be  the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will  believe him.
3744	He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will  have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.
3745	The thieves also, which  were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth."
3746	(Promised Messiah, pp.
3747	530-531) (emphasis added)        Ps.
3748	McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment "as Jesus hungon the cross."
3749	That means the person who was scorned in these verses wasChrist.
3750	Who, then, was the "LORD" in whom he trusted?
3751	It was "Jehovah"the Father.
3752	Another example involves Ps.
3753	We shall first consider Ps.
3754	WhileMcConkie only quoted verse 13 of Ps.
3755	31, verse 14 will also be includedto give a complete understanding of the matter.
3756	But I trusted in thee, O LORD [Jehovah]: I said, Thou art my God  [Elohim].
3757	31:13-14)        McConkie said verse 13 referred to Jesus Christ.
3758	Verse 14 goeson to tell that He (Christ) trusted in the "LORD" who is called His"God" or "Elohim."
3759	Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is"Elohim" the Father.
3760	Verse 14, however, reveals that the "Elohim" of theman Jesus is "Jehovah" the Father.
3761	41, McConkie only quoted one verse; however, two verseswill be considered in this examination.
3762	But thou, O LORD [Jehovah], be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that  I may requite them.
3763	41:9-10)        McConkie stated above that verse 9 referred to Judas' role inChrist's death.
3764	Another example involves McConkie's following remark about Ps.
3765	110:4)        Does the "LORD," which is "Jehovah," refer to Christ?
3766	But who, then, is the oneaddressed as the "priest forever after the order of Melchizedek?"
3767	TheBible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ (Heb.
3768	5:8-10;6:20; 7); therefore, the "LORD" (Jehovah) in Ps.
3769	Another example involves Isa.
3770	Of these verses McConkiestated:  "Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah, Isaiah said...
3771	The _Lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all....
3772	However, what he failed to mention isthat they also prove that the Father is "Jehovah."
3773	He called this concept"misinformation" that is "untrue."
3774	2:7) will be examined.
3775	(Promised Messiah, p. 143)        McConkie cited Heb.
3776	1:5 to show that 2 Sam.
3777	2:7refer to Christ who "would come as the Son of God."
3778	Since McConkie firstreferenced 2 Sam.
3779	7:14, this examination will, too.
3780	However, along withverse 14, verses 11-13 will also be included.
3781	Also the  LORD [Jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house.
3782	He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of  his kingdom for ever.
3783	I will be his father, and he shall be my son.
3784	7:11-14)        These verses teach that the "LORD" (Jehovah) would have a Son,the Messiah.
3785	In the second example McConkie cited Ps.
3786	This examinationwill include verse 8.
3787	Notice that it is the "LORD" (Jehovah) who says,"Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee."
3788	Another example involves Mic.
3789	Who, then, is the"LORD his God?"
3790	Another example involves Ps.
3791	_Jesus  applied these passages to himself_ by quoting Isaiah's prophecy.
3792	"The  Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek" (Isa.
3793	61:1), and then saying: "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your  ears" (Luke 4:21).
3794	(Promised Messiah, pp.
3795	182-183) (emphasis added)        The first source McConkie quoted -- Ps.
3796	McConkie said the "anointed" one was Christ.
3797	If that is true,who was "Jehovah?"
3798	If "Jehovah" is always Christ, who was the "anointed"one?
3799	Obviously "Jehovah" is referring to God the Father and the"anointed" is indeed referring to Christ.
3800	The second source McConkiecited is Isa.
3801	Who, then, was the one who anointed Him?
3802	This versesays the "LORD" (Jehovah) did the anointing.
3803	Again, we face the sameproblem.
3804	If "Jehovah" does not refer to the Father, but only to Christ,then Jesus anointed someone, but who?
3805	As McConkie pointed out, "Jesusapplied these passages to himself."
3806	Therefore, the "Jehovah" whoanointed Christ is God the Father.
3807	"However, these should be enough to expose their error.
3808	Now, what about Mormonism's claim that Jesus is "Jehovah," butHe is not "Elohim?"
3809	It is true that Jesus is "Jehovah."
3810	44:6)  [Jesus said] ...I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and  was dead... (Rev.
3811	1:7)  "...I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel... (Isa.
3812	40:10)  ...Behold, I [Christ] come quickly; and my reward is with me... (Rev.
3813	22:12)  "...the LORD [Jehovah] my God shall come, and all the saints with  thee.
3814	14:5)  "...at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.
3815	3:13)  "The LORD [Jehovah] is my shepherd... (Ps.
3816	23:1)  [Jesus said] I am the good shepherd... (John 10:14)  "...saith the Lord GOD [Jehovah].
3817	I will seek that which was lost...  (Ezek.
3818	34:15-16)  ...the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.
3819	(Luke 19:10)  "For I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy  Saviour... (Isa.
3820	8:28,39 and John 2:24-25;  Isa.
3821	8:26; Prov.3:12 and  Rev.
3822	I will  forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.
3823	what shall I say unto them?
3824	3:4,7,13-15)  "And God [Elohim] spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD  [Jehovah].
3825	1:9)  "For who is God [Elohim] save the LORD [Jehovah]?
3826	or who is a rock  save our God [Elohim]?
3827	18:31)  "Blessed is the nation whose God [Elohim] is the LORD [Jehovah]...  (Ps.
3828	144:15)  "Hast thou not known?
3829	there is no searching of his  understanding.
3830	6:2)  "...the Great the Mighty God [Elohim], the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts, is  his name.
3831	32:18)  "O my God [Elohim], make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the  wind....
3832	83:13,16,18)        The Bible clearly teaches that "Jehovah" is "Elohim."
3833	In fact,He is the only "Elohim" there is.
3834	He is the "true," the "living," the"mighty," the "great," and the "everlasting Elohim."
3835	He is the "Elohim"of Israel, of all the kingdoms of the earth, and of the heavens.
3836	He isthe Creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth andall that dwell thereon.
3837	"Jehovah's" name is "Elohim of hosts."
3838	(Amos5:27)        Not only is "Jehovah," "Elohim," but "Elohim" is "Jehovah."
3839	TheBible reveals that "Elohim's" name is "Jah" (Ps.
3840	68:4), "Jehovah" (Ps.83:18), and "Jehovah of hosts."
3841	32:18)   The nationwhose "Elohim" is "Jehovah" is blessed.
3842	33:12) Clearly, this is notthe "Jehovah" and "Elohim" of the Mormons.
3843	He is The Son, as they are sons and daughters ofElohim."
3844	_But when it came toplacing man on earth, there was a change in Creators_.
3845	That is, theFather himself became personally involved.
3846	All things were created bythe Son, using the power delegated by the Father, except man.
3847	_In thespirit and again in the flesh, man was created by the Father_.
3848	There wasno delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation wasconcerned."
3849	They maintain that the Mormon "Elohim," who isthe father, created man both in spirit and body.
3850	The Bible reveals thetruth about who created man.
3851	12:1) (emphasis added)  "...the LORD [Jehovah]...made us this soul... (Jer.
3852	I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things... (Isa.
3853	44:24)  (emphasis added)  "Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah]...
3854	I have made the earth, and _created man_ upon it... (Isa.
3855	42:5)  "...Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts, the God [Elohim] of  Israel...
3856	I have made the earth, _the man_ and the beast that are upon  the ground... (Jer.
3857	He did indeed "create man."
3858	Although Mormon leaders teach that Jesus did not create man,Mormon scriptures teach that he did.
3859	The BoM states the following:  "Behold, I am Jesus Christ.
3860	Behold _he created Adam_... (Mor.
3861	Michael or Adam was one of these.
3862	(Doctrines  of Salvation, vol.
3863	44:24)  "Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of  the sea.
3864	(Job 9:8)        "Jehovah," by Himself, created all things.
3865	He had no allegedpreexistent spirit helpers assisting Him.
3866	Regarding the Mormon 'Elohim," the Apostle McConkie stated:"Elohim.
3867	(MormonDoctrine, p. 224) He also stated that "Jesus...is above all save theFather only."
3868	"For the LORD [Jehovah] is a great God [El], and a great King above  all gods [Elohim].
3869	97:9)  "Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods  [Elohim]... (Exod.
3870	This is plain sectarian nonsense.
3871	Our prayers are addressed to the  Father, and to him only....
3872	The following is but a smallsample of the vast number of times people prayed to "Jehovah."
3873	38:5)  "I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid.
3874	For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when  thou mayest be found... (Ps.
3875	32:5-6)        Notice above in Ps.
3876	32:6 that the "godly" pray to "Jehovah.
3877	The Bible reveals there is only one true "Elohim," and His nameis "Jehovah."
3878	All other "Elohim" are false.
3879	They are idols that causetheir followers to commit adultery against the true "Elohim" andidolatry.
3880	For all the gods [Elohim] of the nations are idols: but the LORD  [Jehovah] made the heavens.
3881	96:4-5)  "Thou shalt have no other gods [Elohim] before me.
3882	20:3)  "Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods  [Elohim]... (Exod.
3883	8:19)  "Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods [Elohim].
3884	23:7)  "...neither walk after other gods [Elohim] to your hurt.
3885	7:6)  "But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God  [Elohim]... (Jer.
3886	2:12)  "Shall a man make gods [Elohim] unto himself, and they are no gods  [Elohim]?
3887	"Jehovah" is greater than any "Elohim," because all other"Elohim" are idols.
3888	The reality behind them is demonic.
3889	32:17)"Jehovah Elohim" has given explicit warnings and guidelines regardingthese false "Elohim."
3890	He told His people not to have any "Elohim" butHim.
3891	"Jehovah Elohim" told His people He wouldeventually judge all false "Elohim" and their followers.
3892	This examination has shown that the "Elohim" of Mormonism, likethe "Elohim" in Ju.
3893	10:6 is not the true "Jehovah Elohim."
3894	They do not have the Son; therefore,they do not have the Father, and they do not have eternal life.
3895	As theApostle Bruce R. McConkie rightly stated: "Salvation comes only byworshiping the true God."
3896	8:19)  "Thou shalt make no covenant with...their gods [Elohim].
3897	(Gen. 35:2)  "...flee from idolatry.
3898	Remember, to know the "only true God" is eternal life.
3899	(John17:3)  "...their gods [Elohim] shall be a snare unto you."

4416	You can always find the latest versionin the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu (18.70.0.226).
4417	Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that willbe looked at by humans.
4418	This means that the image maker can tradeoff file size against output image quality.
4419	(If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, thesize ratio is more like four to one.
4420	If you haveonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantageto you.
4421	Hence JPEG is considerablymore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.
4422	JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit displayhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.
4423	(See section 7 for details.
4424	JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does withoutintroducing visible defects.
4425	This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.
4426	Sharp edges tend tocome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.
4427	You will lose a little image quality if you do.
4428	However, the disk space savings may justifyconverting anyway.
4429	Beprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will notconvert well.
4430	[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?Pretty darn well.
4431	This seems to be a typicalratio for real-world scenes.
4432	There seems to be widespread confusion aboutthe meaning of these settings.
4433	"Quality 95" does NOT mean "keep 95% of theinformation", as some have claimed.
4434	Thissetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in atypical image.
4435	Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.
4436	-Q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art".
4437	OtherJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely differentquality scale.
4438	Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just"high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.
4439	(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in thesame article.)
4440	It can also do format conversion and some simple imagemanipulations.
4441	It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.
4442	If you prefer not to be on the bleedingedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.
4443	But 2.21 worksfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.
4444	If you just want a simpleimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.
4445	The nextxloadimage release will fix this.)
4446	xli is also free and available fromexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.
4447	This is a good basicviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.
4448	Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are nobigger than your screen.
4449	This is easier toinstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.
4450	It is faster than DVPEG but alittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.
4451	Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see agood JPEG capability in CSHOW.
4452	VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the rightthing with hi-color displays.
4453	Since HSI-formatfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.
4454	Version2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).
4455	This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSIformats) to and from many other image formats.

4494	Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current releaseis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.
4495	(This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget toretrieve in binary mode.)
4496	This process is called "color quantization".
4497	(This is somethingof a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term.
4498	We're stuck withthe standard usage though.
4499	)Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.
4500	Each original color gets "smeared"into a group of nearby colors.
4501	The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.
4502	I occasionally seeposted images described as "256-color JPEG".
4503	)On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to256 or fewer colors.
4504	This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say morethan that here.
4505	If you need help inusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.
4506	[9]  What about lossless JPEG?There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.
4507	There is still a good deal of information loss in thecolor subsampling step.
4508	(With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say"-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling.
4509	Keep in mind that many commercialJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.
4510	This performs better than JPEGlossless on such images.
4511	* TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.
4512	QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrappedinside the Mac-specific PICT structure.
4513	These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIFformat.
4514	By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed byHSI.
4515	This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not beused for Usenet postings.
4516	Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.
4517	(Thisapplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIFformat by default.
4518	You can tellwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:1.
4519	If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a    "raw JPEG" file.
4520	This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---    it's worth a try, anyway.3.
4521	HSI files start with 'hsi1'.
4522	You're out of luck unless you have HSI    software.
4523	Strip off    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.5.
4524	Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.
4525	If you are    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.
4526	On typical images, arithmetic codingproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.
4527	(All thefile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.
4528	Stay tuned for further details.
4529	Even this is not true; at least, not with the currentfree JPEG software.
4530	It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundofferror.
4531	(It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.
4532	Even such simple changesas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.
4533	Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lotof compression/decompression time this way :-).
4534	You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable qualitywill be *larger* than the GIF.
4535	(So check the sizes too.
4536	While useless, this was nearly free in terms ofstorage cost in GIF files.
4537	Do yourselfa favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.

4720	"Good" on the other hand is a value judgement.
4721	Now we do sometimes attempt to give the word "good" anobjective meaning, e.g.
4722	"good" has been used to denote strength, resiliency,speed, etc.
4723	This is verifiable; when you "get in someone's face,"they will often retaliate.
4724	Nowas to whether this enforcing of morality is "good" or "bad," is quitesubjective.
4725	Tain't necessarily so.
4726	On the other hand, something subjective can also be either"absolutist," or "true."

4744	First, Andrew is correct, although I can see where there might besome confusion.
4745	It is indeed possible to have two cards *configured* to usethe same interrupt.
4746	For some time, I was short of "free interrupts."
4747	I had atape controller (not a "floppy tape") that needed one of IRQ0-IRQ7.
4748	(It's an*old* tape drive.)
4749	My solution was to use IRQ3 (also used for COM2, where mymodem is).
4750	I did this because I reasoned I would never be using the modem andthe tape simultaneously.
4751	When kermit runs, it installs its own interrupthandler for IRQ3 and uses the serial port.
4752	(And since the tape controller would not be serviced, it wouldmost likely "hang.")
4753	Likewise, when the tape backup software runs, itinstalls an interrupt handler for IRQ3.
4754	That handler won't do anything forthe serial port.Under DOS, printing is NOT interrupt-driven.
4755	Seems to me that this makes>*chain* drive more efficient, hmmmmm??

4905	This introductory document is posted to all of the concerned  newsgroups.
4906	Which questions appear  in which FAQs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong  where.
4907	For  example to find "Where can I FTP Macintosh software?"
4908	search for  the string  "(2.1)".

4913	It's posted every 2 to 3 weeks in comp.unix.aux  and news.answers.
4914	It's available for anonymous ftp at  jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov.
4915	WHICH NEWSGROUP SHOULD I POST TO?
4916	(1.3)        There are no stupid questions, but there are misplaced ones.
4917	Ignorance of basic netiquette is not an  excuse.
4918	If you want people to help you, you need to learn their  ways of  communicating.
4919	Posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering  silence.
4920	Please post to exactly ONE newsgroup.
4921	For the same reason comp.sys.mac.misc should not be used as a  catch-all newsgroup.
4922	Questions about MacOS system software  belong in comp.sys.mac.system.
4923	Questions about utilities and  extensions normally belong in comp.sys.mac.misc.
4924	Questions about  A/UX go to comp.unix.aux.
4925	Detailed questions about Appletalk  belong in comp.protocols.appletalk.
4926	Direct questions about HyperCard to comp.sys.mac.hypercard.
4927	might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup.
4928	Political and  religious questions (The Mac is better than Windows!
4929	belong in comp.sys.mac.advocacy.
4930	Anything not  specifically mentioned above probably belongs in comp.sys.mac.misc.
4931	Usenet's a big place  and not everything relevant to the Macintosh happens in  comp.sys.mac.
4932	SOMEONE JUST ASKED WHY THE SYSTEM WAS TAKING UP SIXTEEN OF THEIR  TWENTY MEGABYTES OF RAM.
4933	Frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as  frequent questions.
4934	===  FTP  (2.0)  === WHERE CAN I FTP MAC SOFTWARE?
4935	Those in   the U.K. should look first at src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.2.1).
4936	Japanese  users will find sumex mirrored at ftp.u-tokyo.ac.jp  (130.69.254.254).
4937	A fourth very important site is ftp.apple.com (130.43.2.3).
4938	CAN I GET SHAREWARE BY E-MAIL?
4939	The listserver responds to the commands $MACARCH HELP, $MACARCH  INDEX, and $MACARCH GET filename.
4940	Mac archive files are available  from mac@mac.archive.umich.edu.
4941	You can retrieve files from other sites by using  the server at ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.
4942	For details send it a  message with just the text "help" (no quotes).
4943	WHERE CAN I FIND APPLICATION X?
4944	These sites index the tens of  thousands of files available for anonymous ftp.
4945	Substring  searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross.
4946	To avoid many  erroneous matches add a ".
4947	*\.hqx" to the end of the substring, e.g.
4948	CAN SOMEONE MAIL ME APPLICATION X?
4949	(The Macintosh uses a special  two-fork filing system that chokes most other computers.)
4950	How a file has been translated and compressed for  transmission is indicated by its suffix.
4951	Normally a file will have  a name something like filename.xxx.yyy.
4952	.xxx indicates how it was  compressed and .yyy indicates how it was translated.
4953	To use a file  you've FTP'd and downloaded to your Mac you'll need to reverse the  process.
4954	Most files you get from the net require a two-step  decoding process.
4955	Which programs decode which file types is covered in the table  below.
4956	The freeware StuffIt Expander will unstuff  all of them.
4957	You need to get a more recent version of StuffIt or StuffIt  Expander.
4958	It can't decompress  everything.
4959	In particular it can't decompress the new StuffIt 3.0  archives.
4960	It can be found at sumex-aim in the  info-mac/unix directory.
4961	A few notes on the compression formats:      .bin:  These are MacBinary files.
4962	Always use a binary file  transfer protocol when transferring them, never ASCII or text.
4963	Most files on the net are stored as .hqx instead.
4964	Only rascal  stores most of its files in .bin format.
4965	Instead they   append either .x or .X to self-extracting archives.
4966	HOW CAN I GET BINHEX?
4967	Once you have StuffIt (any version) you don't need BinHex.
4968	Ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu and   login.
4969	Type the word "binary."
4970	Type "cd  mirrors/rascal.ics.utexas.edu/compression" and hit return.
4971	Then  "get StuffIt_Expander_1.0.1_SEA_bin"  and hit return.
4972	HOW CAN I GET BINHEX, STUFFIT, ETC.
4973	(2.7)       You can't.
4974	These are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking  for help.
4975	IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM.
4976	(3.1)      "Microsoft Word is crashing" doesn't say much.
4977	What were you  doing when it crashed?
4978	Can you repeat the actions that lead to the  crash?
4979	For example, "Sometimes  QuarkXPress 3.0 crashes with a coprocessor not installed error."
4980	The former will leave you wondering whether the bug  remains after a given step.
4981	The latter lets you go right to the  problem and see if it's still there or not.
4982	READ THE READ ME FILE.
4983	Often these aren't documented in the  manual.
4984	Read any READ ME files to see if any of the problems sound  familiar.
4985	(3.3)      Run Disinfectant or another anti-viral across your disk.
4986	REINSTALL THE APPLICATION AND ALL ITS SUPPORT FILES.
4987	This  can cause all types of unexplained, unusual behavior.
4988	Restoring  from original masters will normally fix this.
4989	REINSTALL THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE.
4990	See question 4.6 for a detailed procedure for performing a  clean  reinstall.
4991	So it's time to ISOLATE THE PROBLEM.
4992	(3.6)            You need to find the minimal system on which the problem  will assert itself.
4993	Occasionally applications do     conflict with each other.
4994	b.If you're running System 6, turn off MultiFinder.
4995	If you're     running System 7, allot as much memory to the application as you      can afford.
4996	Sometimes programs just need more memory, especially      when performing complicated operations.
4997	c. If you're running System 7, turn off virtual memory and 32-bit     addressing.
4998	(Can you say Microsoft Word 5.1, boys and girls?
4999	d.Boot from a virgin system floppy.
5000	If the problem disappears     you likely have an init conflict.
5001	You need to progressively remove     extensions until the problem vanishes.
5002	Use a little common sense     when choosing the first extensions to remove.
5003	Once the problem disappears add half of the     most recently removed set back.
5004	Continue until you've narrowed the     conflict down to one extension.
5005	CONTACT TECHNICAL SUPPORT.
5006	(3.7)      By now you should have a very good idea of when, where, and why  the conflict occurs.
5007	If a tech support number is available for the  software, call it.
5008	If you're lucky the company will have a work  around or fix available.
5009	A computer is no different.
5010	Regular tune-ups avoid a lot  of problems.
5011	The following nine-step  program should be performed about every three months.
5012	If you're running System 7 you may also have several  more megabytes in your trash can alone.
5013	Throw them away and empty   the trash.
5014	RETHINK YOUR EXTENSIONS  (4.2)      Some Macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain.
5015	Seriously consider whether you actually need every extension   in your collection.
5016	Cutting back on your  extension habit can really help avoid crashes.
5017	Depending on its size each application has one or more  representatives in the desktop file.
5018	Think of it as a Congress for your Mac.
5019	Every so often it's necessary to throw the bums out and start with  a clean slate.
5020	Fortunately it's easier to rebuild the desktop than  to defeat an incumbent.
5021	One warning: rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments  you've stored in the Get Info boxes.
5022	It will take more than a few minutes.
5023	The more files you  have the longer it will take.
5024	Unfortunately this "parameter  RAM" can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes.
5025	Click Yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter  RAM.
5026	By default this size is set  to 128K, way too small for most Macs with any extensions at all.
5027	The system heap size is stored in the normally non-editable boot  blocks of every system disk.
5028	Merely updating the System software will often not fix system file  corruption.
5029	I recommend doing a clean reinstall.
5030	Boot from the installer floppy of your System disks.
5031	Trash the System file on your hard disk.
5032	These will all be         replaced in the new installation.
5033	Rename the System Folder.
5034	Any name other than System Folder         is  fine.
5035	Double-click the installer script on your System disk.
5036	Then         choose Customize...
5037	Select the appropriate software for your         model Mac and printer.
5038	You'll need to replace         things individually until you find the duplicate piece.
5039	Reinstall any fonts or DA's you removed in step 2.
5040	It's also available for anonymous ftp from ftp.apple.com in  the  directory dts/mac/sys.soft/hdsc.
5041	All of these products occasionally encounter problems they  can't fix.
5042	When that happens it's time to backup (4.7) and  reformat (4.9).
5043	Nonetheless every three  months you  should do a complete backup of your hard disk.
5044	A number of programs are available to make backing up  easier.
5045	Apple included a very basic full backup application with  System 6.
5046	There  are NO freely available backup utilities other than the old HD  Backup from System 6.
5047	As files become more  and more fragmented performance can degrade.
5048	There are several  ways to defragment a hard disk.
5049	), and restore all the files.
5050	Reformatting your hard disk may even  gain you a few extra megabytes of space.
5051	Not all hard disks are  created equal.
5052	Some can hold more data than others.
5053	Your mileage may  vary.)
5054	Apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator  of drive capacity.
5055	Unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to  initialize them.
5056	Most hard disks come with formatting software.
5057	Most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with  their hard drives.
5058	Normally this will be all you need to reformat  your hard disk.
5059	Otherwise disk corruption, crashes, and  data losses are a very good possibility.

5114	- Do they mean that all "COSE-complient" apps will use the Motif  toolkit API?
5115	- Do they mean both of the above?
5116	- Is it possible that there will be a Motif-API complient toolkit with  an OpenLook Look & Feel?
5117	- How about an OLIT/XView/OI/Interviews API toolkit with a Motif L & F?
5118	(I know OI already does this, but will this be considered COSE-complient?)
5119	- Will there be more than one "standard" toolkit API or L & F supported?

5281	In the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total calories.
5282	HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because of their usual high fat intake.
5283	Such a diet is low in meat and dairy fat, high in fiber.

6234	It  handles  sequences  of  images  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.
6235	Over 150 such  image transformation programs  have been developed.
6236	As a result, almost any image processing  task  can be performed quickly and conveniently.
6237	Additionally, HIPS allows  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.
6238	New users  become effective using HIPS on their first day.
6239	HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.
6240	It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual  pages, and on-line documentation.
6241	It runs under the UNIX operating  system.

6511	and "When we       || finish with the Armenians, we'll go after the Russians!"
6512	Igor and I grew up together, we were friends from childhood on.
6513	We got engaged when I was 16.
6514	In 1981, when I was 18, we were married.
6515	Two children were born to us in Sumgait.
6516	That day on my way home from work I passed Lenin Square, where about 1,500 people had gathered.
6517	All of them were shouting, "There's no room for Christians here!"
6518	and "When we finish with the Armenians, we'll go after the Russians!"
6519	And some even cried Out, "Death to the Armenians!"
6520	Absurd rumors had been circulating about town.
6521	I came home, breathless, and told about everything I had seen downtown.
6522	My family couldn't believe it.
6523	My father-in-law Sogomon Markovich Melkumian, wasn't home, he was at an Azerbaijani wedding.
6524	He got out of the car but there was no one there.
6525	Well I was telling him everything, too, and he said, "What, is there no longer anygovernment?"
6526	That same day Igor said, "Papa, something terrible is happening in the city."
6527	And he said, "We'll stay at home, no one will drive us from our own home.
6528	On February 28, that was Sunday, we didn't go out.
6529	We called our relatives and asked them all kinds of questions, and they all said the same thing.
6530	Sometime around evening they started smashing the car of an Armenian from the neighboring building.
6531	Ira, my brother-in-law's wife, and I called the police: they're wrecking a car, help.
6532	I called the school: I had the keys to the classroom.
6533	I told the senior teacher that he should send someone for the keys, I wouldn't be coming in.
6534	"Before that, on the 28th, the Ambartsumian family came over.
6535	I don't know," he said, "we should leave town."
6536	We got a couple of bags together, clothes, food, the bare essentials.
6537	My father even opened up to him and said, "Maybe we'll drive to the dacha, it'll be safer there."
6538	"No," he said, "it'll be worse there, you'll be safer at home."
6539	Close the door and calm the children so they won't hearthat there's anyone home."
6540	The children started crying.
6541	Suddenly Ira, my brother-in-law's wife, suggested, "Let's run out onto the balcony."
6542	We lived on thesecond floor.
6543	We needed to cross over from our balcony to our neighbor's.
6544	Atfirst we couldn't manage it.
6545	The balcony looked onto the street.
6546	At that timepeople were coming home from work, and many just stood there, watching.
6547	I pleaded and begged: "Please, call someone, have someone come!"
6548	I even started shouting.
6549	Either they were afraid or .
6550	They looked as though they were watching a movie.
6551	Some of them started throwing stones at us.
6552	I remember a man's voice saying the Armenians were climbingover to the other balcony.
6553	Ira, my sister-in-law, helped us get the children over there.
6554	I was pregnant, about seven months pregnant.
6555	No, it wasn't yet seven, it was six and a half.
6556	I think Zhasmen went first; you know, I just don't remember it all that well.
6557	My Kristina said, "Mamma, don't throw us over the balcony, we're afraid!"
6558	Lilia was crying, and Kristina and Seryozha were crying too.
6559	Kristina didn't even want to climb over.
6560	She shouted, "I'm staying with Grandmother,I'm staying with Grandma!"
6561	She loved her grandma, more than she loved me.
6562	Ira helped us climb over, with Kristina coming last.
6563	Ira helped us and went back inside.We started pounding on the neighbor's balcony door.
6564	I pounded with my fist, Sevil, open the door, open it, please!"
6565	"No, go away, go anywhere, go, I'm not opening the door."
6566	She was our neighbor, we were friends, we never refused her anything, ever!
6567	And apparently she thought we were going to break the windows, and she opened the door.
6568	I begged, "Please, at least take the children, we'll leave, we'll go back."
6569	"No," she said, "you have to leave."
6570	Her sons ran in, one had a knife.
6571	I became terrified, I took the children and went out in the entryway and went down a few stairs.
6572	I went down and heard a loudspeaker.
6573	One of them said, "Let the Armenian blood flow, none of them should survive!"
6574	When I heard that I went upstairs and started knocking on doors.
6575	No one opened their door for me!
6576	Not on the third floor, or the fourth.
6577	I couldn't see Zhasmen any longer.
6578	Ira came upstairs later.
6579	I even thought that they had let her stay, that they would save her.My head was spinning.
6580	They were killing my family, and here I was in the next entryway with two children.
6581	Seryozha was four, and Kristina was five and a half.
6582	They were crying, "Mamma, we're scared!"
6583	But on the third floor a man did open his door.
6584	I asked, "Open up, let me inside!"
6585	He opened the door slightly and said, "No!"
6586	"No" and that was it!
6587	He said it so sternly: "No!"
6588	I went up to the fifth floor.
6589	I pounded my fists on the door with all my might.
6590	He opened up, the man of the house, and stood there, looking at me.
6591	I was ready to get down on my knees.
6592	I almost did get down on my knees.
6593	"Please, I beg of you, at least take the children."
6594	He wasn't an Azerbaijani, he was a Lezgin.
6595	I don't even know how, but he let me inside.
6596	And when I went in, Zhasmen was already there.
6597	Two minutes hadn't passed when Ira and Lilia came up the stairs.
6598	He didn't want to open the door.
6599	And again I started pleading, "Please, open the door, it's our Ira and Lilia!
6600	And he said, "No, I'm afraid."
6601	I said again and again, "Please, open the door, please!"
6602	He looked at me for a long time and then opened the door after all.
6603	Ira came in with Lilia.
6604	We threw ourselves into each other's arms, crying.
6605	Then the man locked us into the bathroom.
6606	We sat there for a long time.
6607	Through the door he told us, "Calm the children, and calm yourselves down, too.
6608	This man was hiding us, but what of our family?
6609	When I was still in our apartment I had sensed that none of us would come out of this alive.
6610	I said, "Igor, Edik, let's say farewell."
6611	And Edik turned around and looked at me as if to say, is that some kind of joke?
6612	All the same I thought they would kill all of us.
6613	Igor looked at me, too .
6614	But it was already too late!
6615	They started pounding on the door, Igor was standing next to the door.
6616	Before that he had told us, "Go lock yourselves in that room and sit tight."
6617	He thought we were in the room.
6618	But before we went out onto the balcony we went to them: "Edik, Igor, let's say farewell."
6619	Igor didn't think we could climb over to the other balcony.
6620	All the men--Igor, Edik, their father, and Misha Ambartsumian--they all stood next to the door.
6621	They thought they would pound on it a while and leave.
6622	But from the other side of the door they ordered in Azerbaijani: "Open the door!"
6623	We were all silent, waiting.
6624	Someone outside the door said, "They're home,they're in there, break down the door!"
6625	In the hall near the door there were two metal chair legs.
6626	From outside the door they said, "We're counting to five, open up!"
6627	But we were all quiet, we didn't answer them.
6628	We made like no one was home.
6629	We figured they'd leave, they'd get tired and leave.
6630	My father-in-law had said, "It's not possible they'd come into my home.
6631	Everyone knows us, all of Sumgait knows our family, we are on good terms with everyone."
6632	And indeed a day did not pass that there wasn't an Azerbaijani guest at our table.
6633	But now we had to save ourselves, we had to flee from our own home.
6634	That's just what she said.
6635	"We were at Sevil's when they broke into our apartment.
6636	We heard fighting and shouting.
6637	The noise was terrible.
6638	I remember her calling her mother several times.
6639	She called her for a long time .
6640	But the Lezgin said, "It's nothing, calm down, no, it's not in your apartment."
6641	He was lying to me so I'd calm down.
6642	Two hours went by and the Lezgin opened the door and said, "Karina, Igor got away, calm down.
6643	He saw Igor break away and run off with his own eyes.
6644	She shouted, "Save me, Mamma, save me!
6645	She repeated it several times.
6646	There was a wild din.
6647	I thought those were our last moments, and started saying good-bye to my children, kissing them.
6648	I woke them up: "Kristina!
6649	And I tell Ira: "Ira, if something happens, we'll throw ourselves off the balcony."
6650	We were on the fifth floor.
6651	They had a candle burning.
6652	He said, "Karina, there're no lights on in our block."
6653	The whole block was dark, the whole block!
6654	It's a huge block, too.
6655	I said, "What are you saying, we'll leave now.
6656	But we can't just leavewith the children in the middle of the night.
6657	Give us time to find somewhereelse to hide."
6658	He said, "Well OK, go look."
6659	I asked Ira, "Ira, do you want togo?"
6660	Ira said, "No, I'll stay with the children, Karina."
6661	I said, "Fine, thenI'll go."
6662	Zhasmen and I went downstairs together.
6663	No one was in the courtyard.
6664	It was dark, pitch black.
6665	And now here I was out in the middle of the night and after aslaughter like that, too.
6666	It was probably after eleven.
6667	Later I called the boarding school and my director answered.
6668	He said, "Karina, where are you?"
6669	Ididn't know, I was calling from a public phone outside and didn't know where I was.
6670	I got confused and hung up the receiver.
6671	From him I only found out what time it was, I asked him, "What time is it?"
6672	He said 11:20, I think, but I don't really remember.
6673	So anyway Zhasmen and I went out into the courtyard.
6674	I look and see what appears to be a person not far from our apartment.
6675	And therewas the smell of something burnt.
6676	I looked at the corpse for a long time.
6677	It was either Ira or Edik.
6678	I only saw one of them, Zhasmen grabbed my hand and squeezed it: "Hurry up, let's go .
6679	Hurry up, come on, what are you turning around for?"
6680	We lived in the third entryway, and that truck was next to the fourth.
6681	We walked quickly, holding hands.
6682	I thought, if I go to the police then they'll put me away.
6683	I couldn't count on them.
6684	Before I reached the police station I saw a military vehicle.
6685	And he said, "Go to the police station and tell them everything."
6686	I said, "I'm afraid to go there, I'm afraid of them."
6687	He said, "Don't be afraid.
6688	I didn't go with them, they left me at the police station.
6689	I gave the addresses of my mother and my brothers so that they'd rescue them, too.
6690	First they took us to the KGB, that was at two or three in the morning.
6691	I was pregnant and was wearing nothing but a dress.
6692	Seryozha was only wearing a shirt, and Kristina had a little dress on.
6693	No coat, no boots, nothing!
6694	And I thought that he was probably alive.
6695	But then after two and a half days, they took us, the Armenians of Sumgait, to Nasosny.
6696	My Mamma had come to Nasosny, and she had been looking for me for six days.
6697	Mama, my brothers, and my uncle.
6698	We went to the City Party Committee and waited there in the courtyard.
6699	I was wearing nothing but a dress, and Ira had only a dress on as well.
6700	There was a strong wind on March 6.
6701	And then one of the functionaries told us, "Karina, Ira, gather your courage.
6702	Would you like to go to the burial?"
6703	I said, "What, did they really kill all of them?!"
6704	He said, "Let's look."
6705	He read off all their names and said, "Get in the car, let's go to the burial.
6706	"We buried our family.
6707	I couldn't believe it at the time, I couldn't conceiveof it or imagine it .
6708	Kristina didn't love me the way she loved her grandfather andgrandmother, they spoiled her.
6709	Kristina would always announce, "My grandma is better than anyone!"
6710	"I don't know why, I asked her, "Kristina, where's Papa?"
6711	and she said, "They killed him."

6728	So why was this not a good trade?
6729	The Yanks should have kept him.
6730	What    about Mattingly, you ask?
6731	The Yanks also gave up two    promising propects with Snow for Abbott.
6732	I know Abbotts    only 26, but this was too much to give up.

8210	(the end)----------------------------------------------------------------------  Okay, have at it.
8211	And then Saturday the President will leave here at roughly 8:00 a.m. and fly down to Jamestown.
8212	He will spend the day there, overnight at Camp David.
8213	On Sunday, it's unclear exactly what time he'll leave Camp David and fly to Boston.
8214	He'll leave from Hagerstown.
8215	The press plane will leave from Washington.
8216	He will meet with some --          Q  What kind of a plane is that he's taking?
8217	MS. MYERS:  That he's taking?
8218	He'll probably take a C-20.
8219	MS. MYERS:  From Hagerstown.
8220	Air Force One doesn't fly out of Hagerstown, apparently.
8221	Q  How will the pool travel?
8222	MS. MYERS:  The pool will have to meet him ahead of time.
8223	So I guess the pool will travel with the press plane and wait for him at the airport.
8224	Q  The pool is not going to meet him and watch him get on the plane at Hagerstown?
8225	MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.
8226	Q  What time does he have to be in Boston?
8227	MS. MYERS:  No, it will be at the Boston Harbor Hotel.
8228	And then he will also meet with some -- a youth group that authored something called Project 21.
8229	The speech to the publishers is actually at 3:15 p.m.
8230	It will be followed by Q&A.
8231	And that's it for the weekend.
8232	And what is his reaction to their call on him?
8233	MS. MYERS:  Well, obviously, the letter was written to Secretary Christopher.
8234	I believe Secretary Christopher received the letter on Saturday.
8235	He reviewed it and met with the authors on Monday to discuss their views.
8236	Q  What is the President's reaction?
8237	MS. MYERS:  The President hasn't seen the letter.
8238	It was something that was directed towards Secretary Christopher.
8239	And I think he's, as is everybody, gravely concerned about the situation in Bosnia.
8240	Q  Is he influenced by that?
8241	It's something -- their views will clearly be considered.
8242	I think Secretary Christopher met with the group immediately to discuss their views.
8243	Q  What do you mean, there are options on the table that weren't there before?
8244	Is that on the table?
8245	But I think the President has said he would certainly -- is working with our European allies.
8246	Q  Will he reach a decision -- will he have anything specific to say today?
8247	I mean, in term of there will be no new announcement of policy today.
8248	Q  Does your statement mean he has ruled out unilateral action?
8249	MS. MYERS:  He's continuing to consult with our allies at this point.
8250	MS. MYERS:  Well, I think the U.N.
8251	MS. MYERS:  I think that that's why we're considering additional options.
8252	I think that Mr. Wiesel's comments yesterday were quite compelling.
8253	The situation in Bosnia is tragic.
8254	The President is very concerned about it.
8255	It permits unilateral action by any country in protecting the delivery of humanitarian relief.
8256	But I think that's just an explanation of the resolution.
8257	Q  The President and other officials have ruled out unilateral U.S. action in Bosnia in the past.
8258	You're declining to do that this morning.
8259	Q  That doesn't mean that he won't act alone, which has been said before explicitly.
8260	MS. MYERS:  I don't mean to imply a change in policy.
8261	The President has said all along that he wants to act in concert with our allies on this.
8262	Q  One other little question.
8263	Did he know about this letter from the foreign service officers before it hit the papers?
8264	MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.
8265	Secretary Christopher -- they may have had a private conversation about it.
8266	The President has not seen it.
8267	Q  They met on Monday, right?
8268	MS. MYERS:  No, I didn't say that at all.
8269	I said I won't -- I said I wouldn't comment on any conversations or communications.
8270	MS. MYERS:  I am not confirming anything that Madeleine Albright may or may not have recommended.
8271	MS. MYERS:  I think that their views are obviously being considered.
8272	MS. MYERS:  I think clearly there's a broad policy review underway now.
8273	Q  If I can just follow up, I guess what I'm looking for is what was his reaction to this letter?
8274	Did he say, good, this bolsters my position?
8275	Or did he say, damn, this is just what I don't need right now?
8276	MS. MYERS:  I think he said this helps contribute substantively to the debate.
8277	Q  The unilateral option is on the table?
8278	MS. MYERS:  I think all options are on the table.
8279	Q  We've had two different --          Q  Isn't that a change, Dee Dee?
8280	Q  That would be a change of policy.
8281	Q  Particularly if it includes ground troops, which has been specifically ruled out.
8282	MS. MYERS:  I think the President has been -- well, no.
8283	I don't -- that is not --          Q  Are you talking about all options?
8284	MS. MYERS:  All options -- I think the President has been fairly clear about that.
8285	So let me just review again what he has said.
8286	He has ruled that out from the beginning.
8287	Q  Hasn't he ruled out unilateral action of any sort?
8288	I think that there are a number of very complicated options on the table right now.
8289	This is a very complicated situation.
8290	The options being presented and considered are very complicated.
8291	Q  Air strikes on the table?
8292	Q  You said there was not going to be -- you said you were not announcing a change of policy.
8293	Then you said everything is on the table.
8294	Are unilateral actions on the table?
8295	He's continuing to have discussions.
8296	He's continuing to press them for further action.
8297	And I think that's clear.
8298	The conversation is ongoing.
8299	We're going to continue to work with them to find the best possible solution and next step on this.
8300	Q  The British and the French.
8301	Q  Yes, the British and French.
8302	Does the U.S. believe differently from that?
8303	MS. MYERS:  The President has had conversations with both Mitterrand and Major, as you know.
8304	I think that there is a thorough review of policy going on in those countries as well.
8305	And I think that process is ongoing.
8306	Q     the other day voted against any military intervention yesterday.
8307	The allies have been very, very plain that they do not want to do anything.
8308	MS. MYERS:  The consultations are ongoing.
8309	That's all I can tell you at this point.
8310	Q  Are you saying that there won't be any announcement on Bosnia today in the press conference?
8311	MS. MYERS:  No, that is not the intention of the press conference.
8312	Q  What is the intention?
8313	MS. MYERS:  It's an opportunity to take questions.
8314	That will not happen.
8315	Q  Can you tell us what the subject of the opening statement is?
8316	MS. MYERS:  It's sort of a general statement of where we are.
8317	Q  After the first hundred days, you mean?
8318	MS. MYERS:  It's not a long statement.
8319	I mean, this is just generally.
8320	Don't look for any major policy pronouncements.
8321	Q  Do you know what the opening statement is?
8322	But the overriding purpose of this -- it's not a mystery; it's not meant to be.
8323	It's just to take questions.
8324	Q  It would be helpful to know whether -- what the opening statement is on.
8325	Will he announce that today?
8326	And what's the delay on that?
8327	MS. MYERS:  I don't think we meant to imply -- I think we said it would happen soon.
8328	I don't think we meant to imply with any certainty that it would be this week.
8329	I don't anticipate that happening today.
8330	Isn't this the perfect time to announce an AIDS czar?
8331	MS. MYERS:  I don't know that it's a delay.
8332	Q  Dee Dee, what are Zoe Baird's qualifications for the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board?
8333	And why wasn't her appointment announced here?
8334	I think there are a number of people there on the board with different backgrounds.
8335	Many of them have long histories in intelligence or other government service.
8336	MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that the American people ever had -- voted on her.
8337	And I certainly -- she was never rejected in the Senate.
8338	She never went up there for a hearing.
8339	But the President believes she's a very competent person.
8340	He's said that -- Zoe Baird -- do you understand what the question is?
8341	Q  Her nomination was withdrawn after public outrage over violating federal laws?
8342	MS. MYERS:  Right, she never -- she was never -- but you said she was rejected by the Senate.
8343	I was just simply trying to point out that she was never voted on by the Senate.
8344	Q  So you don't think that is any problem?
8345	MS. MYERS:  I don't think there's any problem.
8346	Q  She has been appointed to this board, is that a fact?
8347	Q  Does she need confirmation for this?
8348	Does she need confirmation to be a member of the --          MS. MYERS:  No.
8349	It's a presidential appointment.
8350	Q  Usually, announcements are made here at the White House.
8351	Was there a decision not to announce her publicly?
8352	MS. MYERS:  We didn't make an announcement.
8353	People who asked were told who  the members of the board were.
8354	We didn't make an official announcement.
8355	If anybody's interested in that we can certainly put out the list of names.
8356	MS. MYERS:  Not always.
8357	But, again, I'm happy to put this out.
8358	Q  Isn't that the standard practice?
8359	Q  That was past practice.
8360	MS. MYERS:  Again, I'm happy to put it out.
8361	We'll put out a list of the members of the board today.
8362	MS. MYERS:  I think generally but not always.
8363	And we're happy to put that out today.
8364	Q  What is the board, what is her title, what is the size of the board?
8365	MS. MYERS:  There is roughly a dozen members on the board.
8366	Again, the chairman of that board is Admiral William Crowe.
8367	Q  And did he recommend Baird?
8368	Q  What's the name of the board?
8369	MS. MYERS:  It's the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, PFIAB.
8370	Q  What's her qualification -- that she had employed an illegal alien?
8371	Q  Let me phrase it another way.
8372	MS. MYERS:  Because it's not.
8373	Q  What's her experience in foreign intelligence?
8374	And I think part of the mission of this board is to provide civilian input.
8375	MS. MYERS:  I don't think so.
8376	So I don't believe there's ever been any --          Q  Earlier than that, during the transition.
8377	MS. MYERS:  No, I don't believe so.
8378	It was announced, again, on December 24th.
8379	Admiral Crowe couldn't be there, but it was announced.
8380	MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so, but I'll double-check.
8381	I guess it's the Texas Ranger reports.
8382	MS. MYERS:  Most of the information is coming -- the federal information is coming from the site.
8383	Clearly, there's been some discrepancies and the Justice Department is looking into it.
8384	I think there's some discrepancy about that, and the Justice Department is looking into it.
8385	MS. MYERS:  I don't know that he's going to try to mediate the dispute.
8386	I mean, I'll let you know if there's anything he intends to do about it.
8387	Q  Is there any one agency or official down there in charge of everything?
8388	MS. MYERS:  I don't know.
8389	I'll have to get back to you on that.
8390	Q  What is the subject matter of Sunday's speech?
8391	MS. MYERS:  It's going to be fairly general.
8392	I don't think it's going to be any specific announcements.
8393	MS. MYERS:  We're still working on it.
8394	But I wouldn't look for any announcements of, like, the drug czar or something like that.
8395	Q  Is it sort of a 100 days speech, sort of "my excellent adventure for 100 days"?
8396	MS. MYERS:  A little bit of both, but I think a lot of domestic.
8397	MS. MYERS:  Yes, more of an overview than a specific policy announcement.
8398	MS. MYERS:  It will be a letter read to the crowd by Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi.
8399	Q  Is that available?
8400	MS. MYERS:  Not yet, but it will be.
8401	Q  What was the question?
8402	MS. MYERS:  I don't --          Q  Likely?
8403	MS. MYERS:  Possible.
8404	Do you have days yet for them?
8405	Q  Can you tell us which order?
8406	MS. MYERS:  Campaign finance reform first; national service later in the week.
8407	Q  Is there any coverage tomorrow in Williamsburg?
8408	Q  And any report in the aftermath of the day?
8409	MS. MYERS:  Any readout from the day?
8410	MS. MYERS:  It's possible.
8411	Jeff Eller will be down there.
8412	I think he can go through what the President did during the day.
8413	We don't expect any photo op or anything, other than departure here in the morning.
8414	In fact, he's been there -- what -- once or twice?
8415	And this is just an opportunity to do the same.
8416	Q  There's no march there.
8417	Q  It has nothing to do with the march here?
8418	Q  Flying straight did you say?
8419	Q  George took a question yesterday on Waco.
8420	Do you have an answer on that?
8421	THE PRESS:  Thank you.
8422	For those Turkish Cypriots whose grandparents have been living on the island since 1571.
8423	The history speaks for itself.
8424	Ofcourse, the Greek governments will have to bear the consequences for this irresponsible conduct.
8425	Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the24th   December  1963.
8426	Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was woundedduring the same terrible event.
8427	We were  all sittinghaving supper.
8428	Altogether we were  nine persons.
8429	We all  hid inthe bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet.
8430	During these  moments I  heardvoices saying, in  Greek, "You want Taksim eh!"
8431	and then bulletsstarted flying in the bathroom.
8432	Mrs. Ilhan and her three childrenfell into  the bath.
8433	At this moment  the Greeks,who broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again.
8434	I and the rest of theneighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded.
8435	But whathad happened to my wife?
8436	Then I remembered and immediately ran tothe  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body.
8437	Is  there no one to save us?"
8438	Ithought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was notdead they would kill  me.
8439	So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myselfunder the double-bed.An our  passed by.
8440	In the  distance I could still  hear shots.
8441	Mymouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank somewater.
8442	Ithought morning would never come.
8443	We were all wounded and neededto be taken  to hospital.
8444	There  I  have had  four  monthstreatment but still I cannot use  my arm.
8445	They then released me.
8446	2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our wayinto  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.
8447	(Sahak Melkonian - 1920)
8448	Tomy surprise, the size of the car doesn't bother me at all -- it seemsjust as nimble as my Celica!
8449	(No comparisons with my Oldsmobile.
8450	Parallel parking is a bitmore difficult, but other than that, I love the size.
8451	I was notdisappointed.
8452	Base performance of the engine under 4000 rpms isgood.
8453	You can even do reasonable launches from second gear, althoughI don't make a practice of this.
8454	The engine revs smoothly and eagerly-- tooling around town does not require many shifts.
8455	This is goodsince the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car.
8456	(More on this later.)
8457	The entire clutch assembly on my SHO has been replaced under aFord recall in 1991.
8458	The clutch on the SHO feels no stiffer than theone on my Toyota Celica.
8459	In fact, the friction point seems a bitlarger and more forgiving.
8460	When playing with the shifter with the car parked, the shifterfelt very reasonable.
8461	The 1-2 and 3-4 gates were where you'd expectit to be, and the shifting action was smooth.
8462	On the road, it'smuch the same -- but you have to shift SLOWLY!
8463	Make no mistake, it'sa clumsy shifter.
8464	I find thispretty amazing in a car like this.
8465	It also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothestshifts when you take your time.
8466	I now shift much more sedately, and the shifter seems morereasonable.
8467	When you play within these bounds, the shifter workssmoothly with no surprises.
8468	I don't know whether the rod shifterupgrade would help at all.
8469	Along these same lines, I initially had trouble shifting gearssmoothly.
8470	This tookseveral days for me to get the hang of.
8471	Occasionally, I have trouble shifting into reverse.
8472	The shifterrefuses to enter the gate, and I often grind the synchros trying to get it into gear.
8473	I'll be watching this carefully in the next coupleof months.
8474	Not terribly loud, but the passenger candefinitely hear it.
8475	I asked about it when I was looking at the car,as do all my passengers.
8476	Paint chipping on the front bumper and grille arevirtually non-existent.
8477	I've seen a couple SHOs whose owners havecolored these in with florescent colors or in black.
8478	I don't think the car is flashy.
8479	:-)Interior:    The interior is what really makes me feel like I don't deserve thecar.
8480	The instrumentation is stock Taurus, except for the 140 mph speedoand 8000 rpm tach.
8481	There's map-holders in the doors, and an oddly smallglove compartment.
8482	Hey, I'm really impressed with the ergonomics andthoughtfulness that went into its design.
8483	And it's a 1989, before theinterior was upgraded!
8484	The backseat is bigger than any car I've had.
8485	Why do they need somuch space?
8486	:-)  (No smart-ass comments, please.
8487	:-)    The driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters.
8488	Fromwhat I hear, it's not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear.Mine is no exception.
8489	A big surprise for me:  I forgot that SHOs don't have a normalhand parking brake.
8490	Instead, they have the regular parking brake thatyou press with your left foot.
8491	It's stiffer thanany car I've had.
8492	A friend's new 1993 Toyota Celica ST seems tauterand is still able to soak up bumps better.
8493	The SHO seems stiffer withless ability to soak up bumps.
8494	Driving over railroad tracks is anoisy and jarring affair.
8495	On the highway, the ride is great.
8496	It's a relativelyquiet ride, but the sunroof rattles.
8497	No easy way to get rid of it, I think.
8498	(Not for me, mind you.
8499	But I wonder whether I wouldadvise my dad to buy one for himself.)
8500	The ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to thewheels.
8501	I feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steermaking the car skitter left and right.
8502	After I understood this, Iavoid the limits of traction -- and I'm a happy camper again.
8503	It's not body rigidity, but the composure of the car.
8504	IMHO, it's much betterthan the steering on my Celica ST.
8505	Activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy -- loud squealing asit retracts on its rails.
8506	I wonder if there is a quick fix for this.Again, other days it completely disappears.
8507	(Function of humidity?)
8508	I wish the seats had more support under the thighs.
8509	Also, I wish theside bolsters would close more tightly.
8510	I hear that tires for this car can get really expensive.
8511	Icurrently have Goodyear GT+4s that cost the previous owner $500for four.
8512	I used to hate the Ford stereo systems -- whose idea was itto use a volume *paddle*?
8513	Now, to my amazement, I don'treally mind...  and sometimes think it's an okay idea!!
8514	!Pretty ridiculous, though.
8515	Getting up to 4000 rpm sometimes seems to be a chore.
8516	But,this is no big deal.
8517	There is more than enough torquedown low.
8518	I often goof up the shifting when driving with friends.
8519	Ittook me a couple of days before I could really shiftsmoothly from 2nd to 3rd gear.
8520	(Hard to believe, isn't it?)
8521	My car has almost 93,000 miles on it.
8522	My parents noted thatit is almost impossible to find a low-mileage SHO.
8523	Astute observation, IMHO.
8524	:-)    The goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop.
8525	I onceparked the car in gear, and then accidentally let out the clutchafter I started it.
8526	Also, I began to wonder how strong that brake really is.
8527	The driver's power window creaks when closed all the way.
8528	The same    thing happens in my parents 1989 Mercury Sable.
8529	Oddly, all theother windows work smoothly.
8530	LIKES:    I'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day.
8531	The    cupholders are great.
8532	I didn't expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much, butit really is handy.
8533	You can lock all the doors bypressing the 7/8 and 9/10 buttons together!
8534	Andyou can never lock yourself out of the car.
8535	I really feel like I don't deserve this car.
8536	I really can'tbelieve that I could afford it.
8537	I got this car ten years ahead of schedule.
8538	:-)    I love this car so much that I've been telling my parents tolook into buying one.
8539	For under $7000, youcan't beat it.
8540	(Next time with an airbag and ABS, though.)
8541	Insurance-wise, this car is also a big win.
8542	Owners of SHOs are alwaysquick to respond, and are very vocal fans of the cars.

8864	Christ Himself alluded to the Psalms over 50times.
8865	The Psalms are the Prayer Book of the Bible.1.
8866	"The rejection of any part of God's Word is a rejection of thegiver of that Word, God Himself.2.
8867	The Psalms occupied anenormous place in the life of our Lord.
8868	"Father, into your hands I commit my Spirit" Ps 31:5"My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?"
8869	Awayfrom me, you evildoers'. "
8870	Acts 2:30:"being therefore a prophet, ... he foresaw and spoke of theresurrection of Christ.
8871	"David was a witness to Christ in his office, in his lite, and inhis words.
8872	The same words which David spoke, the future Messiahspoke through him.
8873	The prayers of David were prayed also byChrist.
8874	Christ in the day of His crucifixion was charged withthe sin of His people.
8875	He appropriated to Himself those debts forwhich He had made Himself responsible.
8876	Our Lord was thesubstitution for the sinner.
8877	He took the sinners place (Isaiah53).
8878	Christ is praying theimprecatory Psalms!
8879	All the Psalms are messianic.
8880	It is the LordJesus Christ who is praying these prayers of vengeance.
8881	His prayers will be answered!
8882	God's Word is revealedupon all who oppose Christ.
8883	Matt 25:41All the enemies of the Lord need to hear these Psalms.
8884	*God'sKingdom is at War.
8885	* The powers of evil will tall and God alonewill reign forever!
8886	He will punish those who do not obey the Gospelof our Lord Jesus.
8887	In the Psalms we seeboth the vengeance and the love ot God.Even in the N.T.
8888	& in the Gospels we see imprecations.

8892	"* Advance and victory for the Church means defeat and retreat forthe kingdom of darkness.
8893	*There is a life & death struggle between two kingdoms.
8894	The Churchcannot exclude hatred tor satan's kingdom from its love for God'skingdom.
8895	God's kingdom cannot come without satan's kingdom beingdestroyed.
8896	God's will cannot be done on earth without thedestruction of evil.
8897	The glory of God demands the destruction ofevil.
8898	And it isthis that Psalm 83 implores God to again do to His enemies.. "Asyou did to Sisera ..."6.

8901	"If anyone does not love theLord - a curse be on him. "
8902	But we have a problem: those who are called to pass onthose orders to others are refusing to do so.
8903	How then can weexpect to be a united, effective army?
8904	Only then will the Church awake from itslethargy and once again enter the battle.
8905	The eternal truth isthat God cannot be mocked.
8906	Whatever a man sows - that shall hereap (Galatians 6:7).
8907	The wrath of God upon covenantbreakers is real.The "I" of the Psalms is Jesus Christ.
8908	The "we" of the Psalmsincludes those of us in the Lord Jesus.
8909	The enemies are not ourown, individually, but those of the Lord and of His Church.
8910	ThePsalms are ot Christ as Prophet, Priest, and King.
8911	They recordChrist's march in victory against the kingdom of darkness.
8912	God willanswer the psalmist's prayers completely in Jesus Christ on thefinal day of judgment.

9913	He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer.
9914	Anyone keelhauled so long and furiously I'd never heard.
9915	Then abruptly Dro broke into  laughter, quick and simple as child's.
9916	Both were a cover for his sense of guilt, I thought, or hoped.
9917	From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....
9918	The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over the carcass of Djul.
9919	'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp.

9949	But these shots and the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.
9950	At length all shooting petered out.
9951	I got on my horse and rode down toward Djul.

9953	The way was steep and  tough, through dense scrub.

9959	She lay in some stubble  where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting.
9960	The bayonet  had gone through her back, I judged, for blood around was scant.
9961	Between  the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun  dress.
9962	The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants.
9963	He  lay face down in the path by several huts.
9964	One arm reached out to the  pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough.
9965	Steel had jabbed  just below his neck, into the spine.

9988	While progesterone will work, supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better.
9989	There really has been an awful lot of research done on PMS(much more than candida blooms).
9990	218 pts with severe recurring PMS received 200,000 to 300,000IU vitamin A daily or a placebo.
9991	48% getting the high dose vitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of PMS.
9992	Only 10% getting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS sysmptoms.
9993	Clinical Endocrinology 10:1579-89(1950).
9994	After 2-6 months, all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in PMS symptoms.
9995	32 women aged 18-49 with moderate to severe PMS randomly received 50mg B6 daily or placebo.
9996	After 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another 3 months.
9997	Gynecol 70(2):145-49(1987).
9998	55 pts with moderate to severe PMS received 150mg B6 daily or placebo for 2 months.
9999	Birth control pills and over 40 different drugs increase the B6 requirement in man.
10000	Women on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10-15 mg of B6 per day.
10001	The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS appear.
10002	Dr. David R. Rubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted in Clin.
10003	Vitamin B6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each day.
10004	35 pts received 400IU vitamin E daily for 3 cycles or a placebo.
10005	Treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and continued until menstruation.
10006	After 2 months, the Pain Total Index was significantly lower in the magnesium group.

10008	After 2 cycles, both groups received magnesium.

10316	I just got blasted in e-mail for my kidney stone posts.
10317	Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet, as is heart disease and cancer.
10318	When I give dietary advise, it is not intended to encourage people reading this news group(or Sci.
10319	Nutrition where I do most of my posting) to avoid seeing a doctor.
10320	Nothing can be further from the truth.
10321	Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to be ruled out.
10322	Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician, plan and simple.
10323	This group uses high dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease.
10324	But you talk about flying blind, man this is really blind treatment.
10325	No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and minerals are being used.
10326	I'm not saying that some of this stuff couldn't be right on the money, it may well be.
10327	That's where I'm coming from folks.
10328	Blast away if you want,I'm not going to change.
10329	Put me in your killfile if you want, I really don't care.
10330	But I'm also getting hit by a few with an axe to grind.
10331	That's life.Chromium is one of the trace elements.
10332	It has a very limited(but very important) role in the body.
10333	It is used to form glucose tolerance factor(GTF).
10334	GTF is made up of chromium, nicinamide(niacin), glycine, cysteine and glutamic.
10335	Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to form GTF.
10336	Some foods already have GTF(Liver, brewers or nutritional yeast,and black pepper).
10337	When chromium is in GTF, a pretty good absorption is seen(about 20%).
10338	I've been posting in Misc.
10339	Fitness and chromium has come up there several times as a "fat burner".
10340	I wouldn't do it though.
10341	The adequate and safe range for chromium is 50 to 200ug per day.
10342	The average American is getting about 30ug per day from his/her diet.
10343	I'm convinced that the problem is bioavailability.
10344	Glucoma is a little more interesting.
10345	Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin responsive glucose-driven metabolic function.
10346	If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma, that would prompt some attention.
10347	Most clinical labs are not going to run a RBC chromium.
10348	There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail analysis for you, but I wouldn't use them.
10349	This has to change and as more labs run a RBC chromiuum, it will.
10350	Don't take chromium supplements to try to loose weight(they just do not work that way).
10351	If you want to take them and then exercise, that would be great.
10352	If you do have a poor glucose tolerance, ask your doctor to check your chromium status.
10353	If you can't do that, I'll find a doctor who can, thank you very much.Marty B.

10838	Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel asked you yesterday to do something, anything to stop the fighting.
10839	And I want to say, too, let's look at the last three months.
10840	We have made some progress.
10841	And now we have a very much tougher sanctions resolution.
10842	That is going to make a big difference to Serbia.
10843	And we are reviewing other options.
10844	I think we should act.
10845	We should lead -- the United States should lead.
10846	We have led for the last three months.
10847	We have moved the coalition.
10848	And to be fair, our allies in Europe have been willing to do their part.
10849	And they have troops on the ground there.
10850	But I do not think we should act alone, unilaterally, nor do I think we will have to.
10851	THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.
10852	Q  Do you see any parallel between the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and the Holocaust?
10853	THE PRESIDENT:  I think the Holocaust is on a whole different level.
10854	I think it is without precedent or peer in human history.
10855	And I think you have to stand up against it.
10856	We were talking today about all of the other troubles in that region.
10857	Q  Mr. President, by any count, you have not had a good week in your presidency.
10858	The tragedy in Waco, the defeat of your stimulus bill, the standoff in Bosnia.
10859	What did you do wrong and what are you going to do differently?
10860	How do you look at things?
10861	We have abandoned trickle-down economics.
10862	And so we are moving in the right direction economically.
10863	Part of the reason it didn't pass was politics; part of it was a difference in ideas.
10864	There are really people still who believe that it's not needed.
10865	I just disagree with that.
10866	And I hope that I can learn something.
10867	I've just been here 90 days.
10868	So it takes time  to change things.
10869	I think it is a -- I want the situation looked into.
10870	I want us to bring in people who have any insights to bear on that.
10871	I think it's very important that the whole thing be thoroughly gone over.
10872	But I still maintain what I said from the beginning, that the offender there was David Koresh.
10873	And I'm sorry that they killed their children.
10874	He was strongly critical of your stimulus package.
10875	How are you going to handle his political criticism?
10876	Will it complicate your efforts on the Hill with your economic plan?
10877	THE PRESIDENT:  Let me answer that question first.
10878	We're going to revisit all of that over the next few days.
10879	I'm going to be talking to members of Congress and to others to see what we can do about that.
10880	With regard to the economic plan, I must say I found that rather amazing.
10881	I don't want to get into an argument with Mr. Perot.
10882	But, otherwise, the plans are remarkably similar.
10883	I'll be glad to hear them.
10884	Q  To follow up, sir, how do you plan to handle his political criticism?
10885	He's launched a campaign against you.
10886	Maybe he's got some constructive ideas.
10887	I just came here to try to change things.
10888	And I want to do things that help people's lives.
10889	Q  Mr. President, to go back to Bosnia for a minute.
10890	The United States is the last remaining superpower.
10891	Why is it not appropriate in this situation for the United States to act unilaterally?
10892	I haven't ruled out any option for action.
10893	So we are reviewing other options.
10894	They have been justifiably worried about those.
10895	But they have supported the airdrops, the toughening of the sanctions.
10896	I don't have any criticism of the British, the French and others about that.
10897	Q  Would that be military action?
10898	Are you losing your political grip?
10899	THE PRESIDENT:  Give me an example.
10900	Judge Sessions said that there was no child abuse in Waco.
10901	All of these are things you said that you didn't support.
10902	THE PRESIDENT:  First of all, I don't know what -- we know that David Koresh had sex with children.
10903	I think that is undisputed, is it not?
10904	Does anybody dispute that?
10905	Where I come from that qualifies as child abuse.
10906	And we know that he had people teaching these kids how to kill themselves.
10907	I think that qualifies as abuse.
10908	And I'm not criticizing Judge Sessions because I don't know exactly what he said.
10909	And I have heard from her and from others about what they think we ought to do next.
10910	So I wouldn't say that either one of those examples qualifies speaking out of school.
10911	Q  How about the Value Added Tax, Mr. President?
10912	THE PRESIDENT:  What was that?
10913	THE PRESIDENT:  I don't mind them saying they think it's a good idea.
10914	There are all kinds of arguments for it on policy grounds.
10915	That does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it in the health care debate.
10916	No decision has been made on that.
10917	And I have no objection to their expressing their views on that.
10918	I took no -- that wasn't taking a line against an administration policy.
10919	Do you feel now that you will be able to meet their now enhanced expectations?
10920	THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don't know about that.
10921	And I don't know what their -- it depends on what the expectations are.
10922	I believe we need the services of all of our people, and I have said that consistently.
10923	And not as a political proposition.
10924	The first time this issue came up was in 1991 when I was in Boston.
10925	I was just asked the question about it.
10926	THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, but I have not placed a great deal of emphasis on it.
10927	It's gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters and in the press.
10928	I've just simply taken my position and tried to see it through.
10929	And that's what I do.
10930	THE PRESIDENT:  I'm reluctant to get into this.
10931	There are -- those are two of the options.
10932	There are some other options that have been considered.
10933	We must be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear.
10934	The United States is not, should not, become involved as a partisan in a war.
10935	Will it lead to more bloodshed?
10936	What kind of reaction can others have that would undermine the effectiveness of the policy?
10937	But I think both of them deserve some serious consideration, along with some other options we have.
10938	And now many of them are coming up with bills for treatment of Agent Orange.
10939	How can we afford to go to any more of these wars?
10940	But we are, after all, the world's only super power.
10941	And in general, how has his political situation affected your deliberation on Bosnia?
10942	THE PRESIDENT:  No, I have not made any agreement, and he did not ask for that.
10943	We never even discussed that, interestingly enough.
10944	And how would you handle that situation differently now?
10945	And I look forward to that.
10946	Q  Mr. President, what is your assessment of Director Sessions' role in the Waco affair?
10947	And have you made a decision on his future?
10948	And if you haven't, will you give him a personal hearing before you do decide?
10949	And I mean no negative or positive inference.
10950	I have no assessment there.
10951	I stand by what I said before about my general high regard for the FBI.
10952	And that is obviously the difficulty we are wrestling with.
10953	This is clearly the most difficult foreign policy problem we face, and that all of our allies face.
10954	And if it were easy, I suppose it would have been solved before.
10955	We have tried to do more in the last 90 days than was previously done.
10956	THE PRESIDENT:  There may be.
10957	I would remind you that the circumstances were somewhat different.
10958	But we have -- as I say, we've got all of our options under review.
10959	Q  The diplomatic initiative on Haiti is on the verge of collapse.
10960	What can you do to salvage it short of a full-scale military operation?
10961	THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you may know something I don't.
10962	That's not what our people tell me.
10963	I think Mr. Caputo and Ambassador Pezzullo have done together a good job.
10964	It's obvious what their concerns are.
10965	We're working toward that.
10966	But I believe we're going to prevail there.
10967	That was the biggest issue.
10968	We have a 20-year low in interest rates from mortgages.
10969	We have lower interest rates across the board.
10970	We have tens of billions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people refinance their debt.
10971	We have established a new environmental policy, which is dramatically different.
10972	And I have imposed tough ethics requirements on my own administration's officials.
10973	We are working on a whole range of other things.
10974	The welfare reform initiative, to move people from welfare to work.
10975	So I think it is amazing how much has been done.
10976	We also passed the Family Leave bill.
10977	A version of the motor voter bill -- that has not come out of conference back to me yet.
10978	And everything has been passed except the stimulus program.
10979	So I think we're doing fine and we're moving in the right direction.
10980	I feel good about it.
10981	THE PRESIDENT:  Let me recast the question a little bit.
10982	It's a good question -- (laughter) -- it's a good question, but to be fair we've got to recast it.
10983	I think the two things will be tied by many members of Congress.
10984	THE PRESIDENT:  First, let me comment a little on that.
10985	And I expect the report to be acted on in the appropriate way.
10986	It is very specific in its allegations, and it will be pursued.
10987	And I believe he will do that.
10988	Q  Mr. President, to back to Russia for just a minute.
10989	The latest poll show that Mr. Yeltsin will probably win his vote of confidence.
10990	THE PRESIDENT:  I understand that.
10991	You can understand that.
10992	But if they have confidence in the leadership, I think that's all we can ask.
10993	I think he is a genuine democrat -- small d -- and genuinely committed to reform.
10994	I think that we should support that.
10995	THE PRESIDENT:  I think we'll have the agreement ready in the fairly near future.
10996	There must be consequences.
10997	And we're working out the details of that.
10998	But I still feel quite good about it.
10999	And this is just an area where I disagree with Mr. Perot and with others.
11000	I think that's the only way a rich country can grow richer.
11001	So this is an idea battle.
11002	And the answers are not self-evident.
11003	So I just have a difference of opinion.
11004	Do you have a personal view at this point about that issue?
11005	And I have a high regard for him and I appreciate his willingness to serve his country in this way.
11006	I do not know whether that is right or wrong.
11007	And, of course, we want to tell the families of those who were missing in action or who were POWs.
11008	There are still some cases that we don't know the answer to.
11009	But I do believe we're making some progress.
11010	I was encouraged by the last trip.
11011	Q  I'd like to follow up on that.
11012	And we're not there yet.
11013	Again, I have to be guided a little bit by people who know a lot about this.
11014	I just am very influenced by how the families feel.
11015	Are there any plans to do that?
11016	And also, did you underestimate the power of Senator Bob Dole?
11017	I did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that.
11018	So it was a strange set of events.
11019	And we're all strung out and we're divided."
11020	And I think we need to do a reality check.
11021	Because the real losers here were not the President and the administration.
11022	The real losers were the hundreds of thousands of people who won't have jobs now.
11023	We could have put another 700,000 kids to work this summer.
11024	I mean, we could have done a lot of good things with that money.
11025	And I think that is very, very sad.
11026	And it became more political than it should have.
11027	But the underlying rationale I don't think holds a lot of water --that it was deficit spending.
11028	That just won't wash.          Q     and redo --          THE PRESIDENT:  No.
11029	I mean, you know, for example --you mentioned the crime bill.
11030	I think it would be a real mistake not to pass the crime bill.
11031	I mean, the crime bill was almost on the point of passage last year.
11032	And they were all fighting over the Brady Bill.
11033	And surely we can see that we need more police officers on the street.
11034	I mean people are scared in this country and I think we need to go forward.
11035	I feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill.
11036	Q  Mr. President, back to the tailhook report for a second.
11037	There is now an Inspector General's report and the law must take its course.
11038	I don't really think -- I think all I can tell you is what I have already said.
11039	Q  Mr. President, could I ask you for a clarification on Bosnia?
11040	You said that you were not considering introduction of American forces.
11041	Does that include any air forces as well as ground forces, sir?
11042	THE PRESIDENT:  I said ground forces.
11043	Q  You said ground forces.
11044	THE PRESIDENT:  I just don't want to discuss our evaluation of the options anymore.
11045	Did you ever consider in any way participating in some of the activities?
11046	THE PRESIDENT:  Because I -- and, basically, I wouldn't participate in other marches.
11047	To say one is a clarification of the|> other is a breach of logic.
11048	I don't mind people shifting their position on|> an issue.

12260	For MSDOS applications, ISA-based SCSI and IDE controllersgenerally have comparable throughput.

12262	If you're only going to be using MSDOS, stick with IDE.

12331	... After ten days, the authorities came in with tanks to  reimpose their power.
12332	In Nakhitchevan, the last Armenian villages were  deported.
12333	In Ganja, Armenians were attacked and killed.
12334	When were the people of Nagorno-Karabakh ever involved in anagreement?
12335	TheAzeris should not have assumed that Armenians were going to roll over andplay dead.
12336	[AR] Such simple realities must be understood in the West.

12339	Rasizade, international realpolitik is not as simple-minded as you wouldhave us believe.

12341	Ancient Greeks referred to Artsakh as "Orkhistena".
12342	NO Azeris yet!Artsakh was still part of the Armenian Empire of Tigran.
12343	Orkhistena, or Artsakh is refereed to by Strabo, as part of Armenia.
12344	NO Azeris yet!End of the 5th century, Utik and Artsakh became principalities of the Aranshakhiks.
12345	NO Azeris yet!By the 7th century an Artsakh dialect of Armenian formed.
12346	Khachen was the central principality of Artsakh.
12347	Caucasian Muslims around Karabakh!In 1813 Karabagh becomes part of Russia.

12349	The Armenianpercentage of the population was over 90%.
12350	From this day the previous boundaries between  Armenia and Azerbaidzan are annulled.

12738	There is anotherentry in the FAQ containing comments by some other contributors.
12739	Theycan be retrieved from ftp.rutgers.edu aspub/soc.religion.christian/others/homosexuality.
12740	This is a frequently asked question, so I do not post thequestion each time it occurs.
12741	Rather this is an attempt to summarizethe postings we get when we have a discussion.
12742	"First, on the definition of 'homosexual'.
12743	Many groups believe thatthere is a homosexual "orientation", i.e.
12744	a sexual attraction tomembers of the same sex.
12745	This is distinguished from actual homosexualsexual activity.
12746	Homosexuals who abstain from sex are considered bymost groups to be acceptable.
12747	This is often called a 'homosexual orientation'.
12748	It isnot known whether it is genetic or environmental.
12749	There is evidencesuggesting each.
12750	One ofthem is probably genetic.
12751	There are several groups that try to helppeople move from being homosexual to heterosexual.
12752	The best-known isExodus International".
12753	But there certainlyare people who say they have converted.
12754	However this issue is not asimportant as it sounds.
12755	Those who believe homosexuality is wrongbelieve it is intrinsically wrong, defined as such by God.
12756	Ifit's wrong, it's wrong.
12757	I asked one of our experts wherethis came from.
12758	Here's his response: Kinsey (see below) is the sourceof the figure 10 percent.
12759	Ten percent of all adult males havemost of their experiences of homosexually.

12766	(If someone would like to contribute anotherview, I'd be willing to include it.
12767	)Most Christians believe homosexuality (at least genital sex) is wrong.Not all, however.
12768	A few denominations accept it.
12769	The EpiscopalChurch seems to accept it some areas but not others.
12770	But these are unusual -- few churchespermit homosexual church leaders.
12771	How carefully they enforce this isanother issue.
12772	There are several explicit lawsin the OT, e.g.
12773	Leviticus 20:13, and in Rom 1 Paul seems pretty negative onhomosexuality.
12774	Beyond these references, there are some debates.
12775	Somepassages often cited on the subject probably are not relevant.
12776	(There's even some question whether it was homosexual, since theentities involved were angels.)
12777	There's a Jewishinterpretive tradition that the major sin was abuse of guests.
12778	So unless NTjustification can be found, Lev.
12779	alone would not settle the issue.The NT references are all in Paul's letters.
12780	A number of thereferences from Paul are lists of sins in which the words are fairlyvague.
12781	Boswell argues that the words occuring in these lists do notmean homosexual.
12782	Here's what he says: The two Greek words that appearin the lists (i.e.
12783	I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10) are /malakos/ and/arsenokoitai/.
12784	Unfortunately it is not entirely clear what the wordsactually mean.
12785	/malakos/, with a basic meaning of soft, has a varietyof metaphorical meanings in ethical writing.
12786	Boswell suggests"wanton" as a likely equivalent.
12787	The big problem with itis that the word is almost never used.
12788	Paul's writing is the firstoccurence.
12789	Examples of compound words formed either way can be given.In theory it could refer to rapists, etc.
12790	On theother hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on thesubject.
12791	Rom 1 is really about idolatry.
12792	Itwas part of temple prostitution.
12793	Among private citizens, it oftenoccured between adults and children or free people and slaves.
12794	I'mnot in a position to say that it always did, but there are somereasons to think so.
12795	The ancients distinguished between the activeand passive partner.
12796	It was considered disgraceful for a free adultto act as the passive partner.
12797	(This is the reason that an activemode homosexual prostitute would be considered disgraceful.
12798	Hiscustomers would all be people who enjoyed the passive role.)
12799	Thus the considerationsin this paragraph shouldn't be pushed too far.
12800	)Some people have argued that AIDS is a judgement againsthomosexuality.
12801	I'd like to point out that AIDS is transmitted bypromiscuous sex, both homosexual and heterosexual.
12802	Note that in thecreation story work enters human life as a result of sin.
12803	Thisdoesn't mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved.
12804	I've also seen summaries of various research and theresults of various efforts for "conversion".
12805	The issue is that of "cultural relativism".
12806	In most cases, I believe theargument is essentially one of cultural relativism.
12807	actions are the same.
12808	)I am not trying to say that everything in the Bible is culturallyrelative.
12809	"God made me homosexual", and I have no choice.
12810	That doesn't mean it's OK.Most of us have particular things we tend to do wrong.
12811	Some peopleget angry easily.
12812	Others tend to be arrogant.
12813	Others tend to beattraced to women who are married to someone else.
12814	Homosexuality (ifwe view it as wrong) wouldn't be different than any of these otherthings.
12815	None of us can sit back and saythat because God made us the way we are we can just relax.
12816	As Jesussaid, we all have to take up our cross daily.

13375	You are absolutely correct.
13376	Braves fans are nothing but a bunch ofbandwagoners.
13377	I am quite happy toreport now that on the S4, the Servotronic is *inoffensive*.
13378	So there is feel andthere is accuracy in the S4's steering.
13379	But there is also room forimprovement.
13380	What a pressure cooker.
13381	For a turbocharged machine, it is very unusual in that itencourages lazy driving.
13382	Infact, it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame.
13383	Downshiftsare almost unnecessary.
13384	It is more fun to use the "overboost" featurethan to rev the engine.
13385	It takes a few moments for it todevelop overboost but it is well worth waiting for.
13386	Since this is quitea heavy car, one's body parts are not flung around like say, the CorradoVR6.
13387	The smoothness is outstanding, but not quiteup to the standards of a very good 6, e.g.
13388	I'd say thatin terms of refinement, i.e.
13389	Alternately one could use more revs..
13390	In both cases a very small priceto pay for such a fantastic engine.
13391	Thecharacteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic.
13392	Ironically,in europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of theslush.
13393	The car comes with Firestones of size 225/50 ZR16..which is not uncommon at all.
13394	Combined with the flared wheel arches, the S4 has a mouthwatering macho, yet subdued look.
13395	I suppose the two are inter-related, but Idigress.
13396	To use a cliche, the S4's body feels like it has been carvedout of stone.
13397	Flex is totally undetectable, even when going over roughroads.
13398	I consider it tobe inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering.
13399	I  wasable to test the car's cornering powers without too much trepidation.
13400	Ithink a new concept is at work in this car.
13401	With its fat gumball tires,talking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless.
13402	On abanked highway on ramp, I went in slow and started applying power as Iwent around.
13403	I could feel the g forces build to the point where theskin on my face was being tugged sideways.
13404	Yet the car was totally andcompletely obedient to throttle and steering inputs..
13405	It felt that thelimits were not even close to being approached.
13406	The g forces werethrilling, but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangelyuninvolving.
13407	You tell the car what you want and it does it.
13408	I am not toosurprised, since the S4 does not have uprated brakes over the base Audi100 fwd.
13409	Harder pads would help, but that in turn would lead to a morewooden response when cold.
13410	The LS400's fade performance is nothing tobrag about; neither is the Q45's or the Legend's.
13411	All the expectedgizmos are there.. heated seats, power seats, seat memory, power thisand that.
13412	A real disappointment taking into account howmuch the turbo dominates its performance.
13413	The 20 valve turbo 5 is a real gem, even ifit doesn't produce Ferrari sounds.
13414	The 100 seriesAudis have been outstanding in government crash tests.
13415	Especially if the chlorination isn't up to par?

14176	The present government does not spare efforts to recruit new settlers to the block.
14177	But the decrease is not only due to restrictions imposed on entering Israel from Gaza.
14178	It is also due to the drastic curtailment of demand for Gazan labour in Israel.
14179	The livelihood of tens of thousands of Gazans depends on such sub-contracted work."

14183	According to that policy the territories are to be divided into two parts.

14335	Our neighbor is standing on his balcony, too.

14344	I said, "Aunt Tamara, don't worry, Ira is staying here with us, and we'll see her home later."
14345	I couldn't shut my eyes all night long, even until morning.
14346	I was worried aboutVika.
14347	My God, what was going on, what had happened?
14348	There weren't 50 yards between our building and the bus station.
14349	We could see and hear everything perfectly.
14350	If they found an Armenian on the bus, then it started .
14351	.I don't know what to call it .
14352	.-Zinaida: It's called slaughter.-Gayane: The mob would descend on people and beat them.
14353	One person was lying there and they started dragging him.
14354	And you couldn't go anywhere, somehow .
14355	you wanted to be able to see everythingso as to tell of it later.
14356	We wanted to leave Sumgait that day.
14357	Where in the world was our government?
14358	!-Zinaida: We couldn't leave town, of course, because our older daughter wasn'thome.
14359	And at the same time I was terrified for Gaya and Diana.
14360	They murdered his father and two sons."
14361	Valodya is our neighbor, he's an Armenian, he lives on the first floor.
14362	I think, my God, what is happening?!
14363	This was at 12 o'clock in the afternoon.
14364	And I asked, "Did they kill him?"
14365	She says, "No, he's in seriouscondition."
14366	I turned off the street and went down the little way that goes toward the Sputnik store.
14367	There I met another crowd, but these weren't bandits, these were our people from Sumgait.
14368	I was walking and there was a boy standing before my eyes.
14369	This was on the 27th, around evening time.
14370	He ran under our balcony, andthe mob surged toward him shouting, "He's an Armenian, get him!"
14371	He wore a black coat.
14372	They grabbed him, that boy, near the bus stop, I saw it.
14373	My oldest daughter was in my thoughts.
14374	I was thinking, my daughter's coming home now, they'll stop her bus and she'll be gone.
14375	There's no police, no protection, nothing.
14376	It's like they had all died, there's no one, nothing, no authorities whatsoever.
14377	I can't evenfind the words for it!
14378	I look and see an Ikarus arriving.
14379	Before going to the bus station they stop near our place, across from the Kosmos movie theater.
14380	And I see them take the Armenians and beatthem, killing them.
14381	I can't watch it any more.
14382	I just couldn't watch it.
14383	So our children will know.
14384	"Gayane: We saw a great deal on the 27th.
14385	They caught no less than 20 peoplebefore my eyes.
14386	I can't say for sure if they killed them or not .
14387	.-Zinaida: There were too many people there, the mob was too big.
14388	You couldn't make anything out.
14389	But I saw that boy in the black coat with my own eyes.
14390	Hewas 18 or 19 years old.-Gayane: I think he was older, probably, about 22.
14391	A tall fellow, a big guy, in a coat.
14392	He was walking quickly, but when they shouted that he was anArmenian, he tore off running.
14393	And the mob went after him.
14394	They caught him right under our balcony.
14395	I don't think there could have been much left of him after that.
14396	You can imagine what happens when a crowd attacksone person.
14397	It was a mob, big, angry, and featureless.
14398	I couldn't watch any longer.
14399	You couldn't see all of it at once, but when that boy cried "Mamma!"
14400	The police disappeared and yielded theirpositions to the bandits.
14401	There were thousands of people inthe crowd.
14402	Again they began stopping vehicles and checking for Armenians.-Zinaida: They had signals.
14403	The cross,evidently, meant that the vehicle had Armenians in it.
14404	He got out and said they were from Baku.
14405	"But what is yournationality?"
14406	They immediately start shouting, "Ermeni,Ermeni!"
14407	And he says, "What's going on?
14408	I'm coming from Baku.
14409	I don't livein Sumgait."
14410	"Doesn't matter, who cares if you're from Baku or Sumgait.
14411	At this point the police came and took the two and led them away.
14412	Then the mob started smashing the car, and then burned it.
14413	it was a horrible fire!
14414	Then everyone ran away, they thought the car was going to explode.
14415	About 20 minutes later another car comes along, a green Moskvich.
14416	They ran up shouting "Ermeni!
14417	But this time they didn't pull the people out of the car, they didn'tbeat them.
14418	Maybe they burned them along with the car, because no one emerged from the flames.
14419	About two hours later a whole wedding procession came by, and there was a doll on the first car.
14420	We thought they were Armenians, but the cars started to honk loudly.
14421	The Azerbaijanis were cele-brating and dancing.
14422	She went to her girlfriend's in the building, she lives in the first entryway, on the third floor.
14423	Gaya came back and said, "Mamma, the bus is supposed to come aroundeight, after eight."
14424	Then I heard shouting.
14425	They were thrashing about with the pillows and the feathers were lying like snow.
14426	I am walking around the room, crying, wailing: Vika's not here, what will come of her .
14427	"Diana: I saw the green car burn.
14428	The car was burning when we went out onto thebalcony.
14429	Gaya pushed me away, telling me to get off the balcony.
14430	There were terribly many of them.
14431	He said that two people, Azerbaijanis, had been killed in Karabagh.
14432	And when he said that .
14433	you know how bees sound, have you heard how they buzz?
14434	It was like the buzzing of millions of bees .
14435	and with this buzzing they flew into our courtyard, howling and shouting.
14436	I don't know how to describe it.
14437	I realized that they would be upon us any minute.
14438	I shouted to Gayane, "Gaya, hide the gold."
14439	That's honestly what I told my child.
14440	I didn't know what to do!
14441	Vika still wasn't home, and it was already getting dark.
14442	It just didn't do much for us.
14443	In all those years we almost never listened to it.
14444	But sometimes we wouldwatch some entertainment show or film on Azerbaijani television.
14445	And here we had it turned up full blast.
14446	But we already had it on anyway.
14447	Turn on the lights, they told us, so they will think you're not Armenians.
14448	"Turn on the lights," they told us, "please.
14449	"-Zinaida: "We won't allow them to come into your apartment.
14450	"-Gayane: We believed those people.
14451	We had never done anything bad to them.
14452	TheAzerbaijanis were crying, saying, "Can it be there is no God?
14453	How couldthey raise their hands against your family?
14454	How could they give you away?
14455	How could they sell you down the river?"
14456	They really had given us away.
14457	Some of them protected us, butothers gave us away.
14458	Azerbaijani women don't wear pants.
14459	There wasnothing else we could do.
14460	I was forced to turn myself into God knows who.
14461	Take Diana and go into the other room.
14462	You two look more like Armenians.
14463	They'll figure out that we're Armenians right away."
14464	But how could I go away and leave her there?
14465	!-Gayane: I went out onto the balcony.
14466	It worked out better that way.
14467	We were the only Armenian family in the fourth entryway.
14468	This gave us hope: we were the only ones, the neighbors wouldn't let them in.
14469	They, the Azerbaijanis, would fear for themselves and for their children.
14470	So I turned aroundand saw a guy with a knife on our balcony.
14471	He looks at me and shouts, "What nationality are you here?
14472	"-Zinaida: At the same time they were knocking on the door.-Gayane: "What nationality are you?"
14473	If I were an Armenian would I come out to meet you face to face and look you in the eyes?"
14474	He looks at me and tells thepeople with him, "Yes, Azerbaijanis live here."
14475	From below they tell him,"Check it out, it can't be, they have to be Armenians."
14476	And he asks me again,"What nationality are you?"
14477	I say, "Can't you see?"
14478	I couldnot say anything else.
14479	"You're blind, that's for sure!
14480	You can yell all youwant, but that won't make us Armenians."
14481	I hear them breaking down ourdoor, and Mamma went toward the door.
14482	I say, "I don't have time to dealwith you, they're breaking down our door."
14483	1 go to the door and ask, "Who isit?"
14484	They answer, "Open up!"
14485	I say, "Wait, why are you breaking the door?What's going on?
14486	Isay wait, I'm looking for the key.
14487	I opened the door--it was almost brokendown already.
14488	I opened the door and they burst in.
14489	I say, "What's going on?Why are you breaking down our door?
14490	"-Zinaida: Then they started climbing in from the balcony.
14491	They're shouting, "Why don't you open the door?"
14492	And I say, "Well you've already come in the balcony."
14493	Then Diana sees their knives, runs into the bathroom, and closes thedoor.
14494	Gaya cries out, "Mamma, Diana ran into the bathroom!"
14495	That guy climbed in from the balcony with a big knife with a yellow handle.
14496	They put it up to Mamma's stomach.
14497	I ran to the bathroom, opened the door, and slammed it behind me.
14498	I was frightened, and started to cry.
14499	I shouted, "Mamma,they want to kill you!"
14500	then they started shouting, "Give us your passports."
14501	And Gaya says, "What do you need passports for, we're Azerbaijanis.
14502	I could humble myself, because at that moment I was worried about other lives than just my own.
14503	I tell them, "What, don't you understand anything?"
14504	Why shouldn't they do the same to us?
14505	I said, "Who's doing all that?
14506	What does that have to do with us?
14507	Give me the knife, I'llcut my own face."
14508	"Now you calm down," they tell me.Zinaida: I told them, "Why didn't you deal with them there!
14509	Why didn't you give it right back tothem there?
14510	What've we got to do with this?"
14511	One of them was next to me,with a knife at my breast.
14512	And he says to the others, "What pretty girls."
14513	Hemeant Gaya and my 10-year-old Diana.
14514	Gaya started assuring them that we were Azerbaijanis.
14515	One guy stood in the doorway and gave us bad looks.-Gayane: He demanded the passports.
14516	I said, "Young man, I don't have my passport here."
14517	He says, "Let's have the passport, we won't believe youwithout your passport."
14518	And one of them started hurriedly searching fordocuments.
14519	They all started yelling, there was so much noise in the apartment.
14520	They were all shouting.
14521	My hair stood on end.
14522	In fact my husband had died seven yearsearlier, in 1981.
14523	"We're in mourning, and you burst in here demanding docu-ments.
14524	The documents are at the housing office, I'm filing for my pension.
14525	"Well it seemed like they believed us.
14526	Then one guy said, "They're Lezgins.Can't you see, there are no men here, only women.
14527	Another fellow inthe group agreed with him, he also said that we were Lezgins.
14528	But a thirdsaid, "No, they're Armenians."
14529	Well the other two convinced him, I don t know how, and all the rest of them listened to them too.
14530	They started leaving.
14531	Yes, we're Lezgins, we're Lezgins."
14532	They startedleaving, and one of them took our tape recorder with him.
14533	And the one who had first called us Lezgins says, "Leave that, what are you doing?"
14534	I had seen him somewhere.
14535	But I can't remember where.
14536	Theycontinued to argue on their way out.
14537	Some said, "They're Armenians all the same."
14538	We should stay out of the apartment."
14539	"What do you mean, stay out?
14540	And he said, "No, we should stay out, they're Lezgins, we're leaving here."
14541	The three of them protected us.
14542	-Zinaida: No, the two of them.
14543	Well theywere all young really.
14544	He wore a long brown coat.-Diana: He wore a long, darkish brown coat, and his hair was dark too.
14545	And then there is a knock.
14546	I told Gaya, "Take Diana and gointo the other room."
14547	My daughters went into the dining room, and I opened thedoor.
14548	There was a guy there who said, "Run, hide!
14549	They're coming to kill you now!"
14550	We ran up to the third floor.
14551	We had some good neighbors up there,Azerbaijanis.
14552	I sent the kids and stood there alone, not knowing what to do.
14553	Out of a whole room I couldn't even think of anything to take.
14554	I couldn'tsee anything .
14555	I could only see Vika, my older daughter.
14556	He says, "What do you mean, door?
14557	Get out of here, they're coming to kill you!
14558	What are you standing there for?"
14559	We were alreadyat the neighbors'.
14560	"-Zinaida: On the third floor there I started asking the folks, our neighbors,to go meet Vika.
14561	The bus was due to arrive at eight o'clock.
14562	And my tears choked me.
14563	I was going out of mymind.
14564	But no one could leave the building, the courtyard was packed withpeople, swarming with them.
14565	Where did they make off to?"
14566	They told him they didn't know.
14567	They asked him where he lived.
14568	He answered, "Can't you see, on the third floor."
14569	He asked them specially to divert attention from his own apartment.
14570	She didn't notice us, probably because we were next to her.
14571	Her thoughtswere only on Vika.
14572	Thanks to them my children and I arealive, well, and unharmed.
14573	I don't know what I would do."
14574	He of course wouldn't have done anything, he was just trying to calm us down.
14575	A married couple, Vanya and Nina, and their three children.
14576	The crowd shouted, "Look at the naked Armenian!"
14577	They were going to throw the poor woman into thefire.
14578	All the neighbors saw and heard it .
14579	I wasgoing to do it but Gayane wouldn't let me: "Mamma, please!
14580	Mamma, I beg of you!"
14581	The neighbors were sleeping and Gayane woke them with her cries.
14582	He told me he would go himself.
14583	He was gone for about five minutes, but it seemed like an eternity tome.
14584	He returned and said there was no one there, nothing.
14585	I went down too, stole down like a mouse, and slipped in everything was thrown all about.
14586	I began looking for the briefcase with my work in it.
14587	I was miserable because of my daughter, and at the same time because of my work.
14588	I went into thekitchen.
14589	My daughter had hidden some valuables in the gas stove: my ring and my earrings.
14590	Five minutes passed and Gayane ran in and said,"Mamma, hurry."
14591	And Diana came downstairs too.
14592	They threw a television ontothe asphalt, it exploded so violently it sounded like a thunderclap.
14593	Then, when Vika wasn't there, I wouldn't eat, and they forced me, but I couldn't eat.
14594	He was very large and very handsome.
14595	They were beautiful satchels.
14596	I had many books, I collected them, they were in the bedside tables.
14597	And a boy had given me a little apron and a headband for my birthday, they weren't around either.
14598	And I had some big books, fat ones, and they disappeared, only one was left, The Malachite Box.
14599	The Adventures of Karlson, Pippi Longstockings, and Fairy Tales of the World were left.
14600	He's a Russian, Aleksei Semyonovich Lomakin.
14601	Alik Aliyev, the mechanic, came with him.
14602	When they saw my wrecked apartment they were just petrified, they could not say a thing.
14603	When I saw them I started crying.
14604	My Azerbaijani neighbors came in.
14605	Some of them were crying, others were helping me pick up.
14606	I go on looking for my documents and at the same time put things into the wardrobe.
14607	Incidentally, later, when I went back to the apartment again those things weregone too.
14608	And the door was gone.
14609	My God, where could I go it was daytime and those .
14610	Where should I go with two girls?
14611	When I opened the door I had tears in my eyes, and I was terrified .
14612	And he said, "Go to Alik's, he's anAzerbaijani, too."
14613	Everyone feared for their own lives.
14614	I went out into the entryway and stood.
14615	And he says, "any other time I would keep you here a year, or two.
14616	But right now, I'm sorry .
14617	Then another door opened, also on the third floor.
14618	I ask the neighbor, "Tayara, can we hide at your place?"
14619	She's an Azerbaijani too.
14620	She says, "What kind of question is that?
14621	Gaya became ill, and I allowed her to get out.
14622	My legs fell asleep and felt like cannons.
14623	He said that he'd be in the courtyard, and if anything happened his wife would signal him.
14624	My girls went to the window--and what was going on out there!
14625	I feared for my children, that someone would recognize them from the street.
14626	The soldiersdidn't shoot, they didn't have orders to.
14627	I'm a mother after all, and they were no different from mychildren.
14628	I imagined my children in theirshoes .
14629	They caught several Azerbaijanis and started beating them with their clubs.
14630	One fell down and theycracked open another's head .
14631	!-Zinaida: But how could it happen here and not off somewhere in America!
14632	They attacked the soldiers, hurled stones at them .
14633	Then I thought, where's thetear gas that the Americans use to disperse demonstrators?
14634	The soldiers had been there since morning, they didn't bring in fresh troops.
14635	They hadn't eaten, they were fine standing there for about three hours, but then they got tired.
14636	They weren't even allowed to sit down .
14637	At noon they, the soldiers, attacked them, and then the tables were turned.
14638	And meanwhiletanks with machine guns were cruising the streets .
14639	They always say, "Our children have never seen war."
14640	I never even dreamed about it, there was no need to.
14641	But then I thought about those people who had lived through a war.
14642	Itwas truly horrible .
14643	They beat the soldiers with their own clubs and shields.
14644	And those guys stood there and couldn't defend themselves, they couldn't open fire.
14645	They couldn't even defend themselves, let alone us.
14646	.-Zinaida: What are you saying?
14647	It's painfully embarrassing!
14648	And they burned the armored personnel carriers, too.
14649	Someone shouted, "Get away, it's going to blow!"
14650	Everyone scattered away, and the armored personnel carrier exploded.
14651	The soldiers lost their senses.
14652	Only the driver was in it.
14653	The bus ran over three people straight off, I saw it.
14654	And two armored personnel carriers ran over four more.
14655	All in one or two minutes.
14656	The bus ran over three, one of the carriers ran over two, and the second, two more.
14657	But they ran over seven before our eyes.
14658	Then the busploughed into a book kiosk.-Gayane: No, that was a flower place.
14659	They were running around in the courtyard looking for the Armenians.
14660	Then her husband came back and said that a curfew had been imposed.
14661	He says, "Zina, you owe us a drink.
14662	Gorbachev announced a curfew."
14663	He kept making statements, and there were Azerbaijani songs and dances.
14664	Tayara turned the TV all the way up.
14665	We hid in the wardrobe again.
14666	They asked her, "What are you doing here" Tayara answered, "I came to take something for myself."
14667	"Take all you want, they're gone now."
14668	-Zinaida: Yes, she had wanted to get something for us, at least some bedding.
14669	In short, we calmed down, and the crowd raced off to the other building, the one across from us.
14670	As it was we had beendressed the entire time.
14671	Mamma went to check it out .
14672	I both believed it and didn't believe it.
14673	We ran out to the tanks.
14674	Sasha came over and asked about the girls.
14675	I was surprised, how did he know my girls?
14676	He said that he knew me and the girls.
14677	Another neighbor came out, Anna Vasilyevna, a Russian: "Zinochka, my dear, goodbye and good luck."
14678	The bus wouldn't start, so they put us on another one.
14679	And when the Azerbaijanis attacked them, many of the soldiers died.
14680	They threw paving stones--huge rocks--at the soldiers.
14681	The soldiers ran over those Azerbaijanis with thetanks.
14682	And theywere fighting right down there on the street .
14683	Mamma ran upand said, "Get your clothes on, let's go."
14684	Gaya was wearing slippers, and I had on my blue dress, but it was an old one.
14685	I was wearing my old jacket, my old dress, and slippers.
14686	Gaya had on a skirt, her Angora sweater, and slippers.
14687	It was raining hard, and there were puddles on the street.
14688	It was jammed with people and you couldn't breathe.
14689	We asked, "Are these all us?
14690	We were surprised that there wereso many Armenians in Sumgait.
14691	All those years we lived there and didn't know there were so many Armenians, 18,000.
14692	We were struck by that, we had never noticed.
14693	He said that Vika was alive and well.
14694	When I told Mamma she of course calmed down some more.
14695	Whenwe arrived at the City Party Committee we heard everything imaginable!
14696	Itwas the fear of God.
14697	Many people already knew that there had been a pogrom of our apartment.
14698	They had seen the broken windows.
14699	I cried, saying that I didn't know where Vika was.
14700	A second said that her husband andher son had been murdered.
14701	That was Nelli Aramian.
14702	She lived in Building 6 in our microdistrict.
14703	They killed her husband, Armo, and her son Artur.
14704	We went downstairs to the first floor and he called Vika.
14705	I spoke with her, heardthe voice of my child.
14706	She had managed to survive in that hell.
14707	Then I startedbegging that Azerbaijani to bring her to the City Party Committee.
14708	All the same I asked him to get her.
14709	He brought her and I calmed down.
14710	One shouted, "Give me my son back!
14711	", another yelled, "Where is my daughter?!
14712	", a third wanted herhusband .
14713	And he also said that today he was going to go look at all of our apartments.
14714	On March 3 we went to the military barracks in the village of Nasosny.
14715	We were taken care of marvelously by the military.
14716	They sent special flights of children right from there to Minvody, Yerevan, and Moscow.
14717	Everything had passed, but the pain will remain for our whole lives.
14718	It cannot be forgotten.
14719	Under no circumstances should we, our children, or our grandchildren forget.
14720	Who willanswer for those who died?
14721	For our mothers, sisters, brother, sons anddaughters?
14722	Who will bear the responsibility?
14723	Who will wash away their blood?
14724	It isn't over yet, now we live here, in Armenia, protected, but the issue isn't resolved.
14725	We would liketo stay in Armenia, in our homeland, so that all the Armenian people will beunited.
14726	Then we will be invincible.
14727	The only request we have is that we be helped in obtaining an apartment and getting jobs.
14728	So that our children can work for the good of Armenia.
14729	If we aren't able to, then let our children do it.
14730	And if it's possible, we'll work for the good of Armenia too.
14731	This is the land of our forefathers.
14732	Like a mother, the land here bore and reared us.
14733	It is our wife, and will protect us, too.

15749	Cited as part of the National Institute of MentalHealth Task Force on Homosexuality.

15774	He was a fiendish collector.
15775	As a young zoologist witha D.Sc.

15777	Nothing that mammals did in therealm of reproduction was foreign to him.

15781	There was nothinglike it in the literature.
15782	What Freud had only imagined about childhood sexuality, Kinseyhad reported as fact.
15783	Children were indeed erotic beings from thecradle.

16182	I've put together a list andindicated what I think each item is worth.
16183	This is just my estimate, and Iam very open to any offers, including trades.
16184	I really want to get rid of this stuff...Ok, Here's the list:52 Meg 3.5" SCSI Hard Drive.
16185	Conner Model #CP-3150.
16186	I bought this from a guyat a swap meet to use with my Macintosh.
16187	Unfortunately, I can't seem to get it to work with the SCSI controller in my computer.
16188	(I'll send you a copy) I was dumb enough not to get his phone number, so I can't return it to him.
16189	The drive has many jumpers on it, (which I don't know how to set) so maybe that's the problem.
16190	Conner Model #CP-3150.
16191	Same situation as above.I bought both of these drives from the same guy.
16192	Despite the differentmodel numbers they are the same exact drive.
16193	SONY Model #SRD2040A.
16194	The drive mechanism is completely trashed.
16195	This hard drive was in my computer (Mac SE) andhad a stiction problem.
16196	Well I determined that the drive mechanism was fine,and that it was a controller problem.
16197	(motor controller wasn't sendingproper signals.)
16198	I tried to solder it, but I'm not that goodat soldering so I couldn't do it.
16199	Worked perfectly before I messedup.
16200	I used it as a temporary drive when the SONY (above) crashed onme.
16201	Also loaded the drive with about twenty Mac applications,worth well over $1000.
16202	You also get allthe software on the drive.
16203	(if you can accept being a pirate)  I only ask that you delete my data files from the drive.
16204	I was really angrywhen I broke that connection, and then couldn't fix it.
16205	I just don't have time to play with it any more.~$65AT&T ISDN 7500 Modem.
16206	This is for use on digital phone systems.
16207	If you knowwhat this is or would like technical information on it, let me know.
16208	Ihave some tech documents on it.
16209	Is supposed to be the same thing as anAT&T digital phone, but without the phone part.
16210	It seems to be in  working order (passes self test perfectly OK).
16211	I have no idea how this is worth...   Let me know if you're interested.Motorola 68881 CoProcessor.
16212	When I was looking around to buy one new, theprices were around $100.
16213	I will guarantee this to work.~$65CGA Card.
16214	Toshiba Model Number ND-08DE-A.
16215	Came out of same PC as above.~$255.25"Floppy Drives.
16216	Can't guarantee that these will work.
16217	I don'teven know if they are low or high density drives.
16218	I don't haveany method of testing them.Panasonic Model number: JU-455-5 ACG.
16219	There's anothernumber on it: 2626-361723.Panasonic Model number: JU-475-2 AGG.
16220	There's alsoanother number on it: H3649-101457Toshiba Model Number ND-08DE.
16221	Virtually identical to the one above.Each Drive ~$103.5" PS/2 Drive.
16222	These things are proprietary, so I can't test it, but Ithink it works.
16223	Model NumberDFL413C04A.
16224	I think these things are expensive to replace.
16225	~$35MFM Hard Drive Controller Cards.
16226	I've got three of these, and I have no wayof testing them.
16227	Seems to convert from a VGA plug to an EGA plug.

17622	These Greek words have totally different meanings.
17623	The words are Hades, Tartaros, and Gehenna.
17624	Hades may be likened to a hole in the ground.
17625	(In the Bible it has nothing to do with fire!)
17626	Hades is simply the abode we call the grave.
17627	All dead go to this hell.
17628	Nowhere in the Bible is there any mention of men being put into this particular "hell".
17629	The the third word that is translated as "hell" in the Bible is Gehenna.
17630	Itcomes from the Hebrew GAI HINNOM, meaning "valley of Hinniom."
17631	Hinnom is a deep, narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of Jerusalem.
17632	King Josiah of ancient Judah finally put an end to these abominations.
17633	He defiled the valley, rendering it ceremonially unclean (2 Kings 23:10).
17634	The bodies of dispised criminals were also burned there along with the rubbish.
17635	Fires burned continuously, feeding by a constant supply of garbage and refuse.
17636	So what does this valley called Gehenna have to do with hell?
17637	These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone."
17638	Where will this temporary lake of fire (this "hell") be?
17639	But what of the wicked who have died over the millennia?
17640	Does the Bible say that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of fire?
17641	What will become of these wicked?
17642	Will they writhe in flames for eternity?
17643	The wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming Gehenna fire on the earth.
17644	They wil be consumed, annihilated, destroyed!
17645	This punishment will be everlasting (permanent and final).
17646	The Bible does teach eternal punishment, but not eternal punishing.
17647	The prophet Malachi provides a graphic description.
17648	Gehenna was a place of destruction and death, not a place of living torture!
17649	Jesus was talking to Jews who understood all about this Gehenna or valley of Hinnom.
17650	Utter destruction by fire was complete.
17651	Nothing was left, but ashes!
17652	The Bible says, in Romans 6:23, "The wages of sin is death", not eternal life in torture.

18800	Gurvitz phoned the deputyIsraeli consul general in L.A. with the information.
18801	and sources close to theADL.
18802	Israel's charges were playedup on the front page of _The New York Times_.
18803	"If we felt our files were lacking, we contacted the ADL.
18804	Of course, to AIPAC and theADL, Jabarin was a terrorist.
18805	Gurvitz went to two demonstration planning sessions,and a subsequent demonstration.
18806	He wrote a report for the ADL on eachof the planning sessions and on the demonstration.
18807	Gerard agreed and informed the ConsulGeneral, who canceled his appearance.

18838	Yes, ADL looks at broad issues of prejudice anddiscrimination.
18839	Yes, ADL defends Israel against critics.
18840	Indeed, the ADL spies on groups that are neither anti-Semiticnor violent.
18841	Police confiscated ADL files on hundreds of mainstreamgroups ranging from ACT UP to Peace Now.
18842	On April 10, policearmed with search warrants raided ADL offices in San Francisco andL.A.

19082	They also chanted ``Na, na-na-na, hey-hey good bye.
19083	"Such talk is a tad premature.
19084	There's still one game left, but the Blues areon a roll.
19085	Joseph stopped Larmer's shot and everything else Chicago threwat him in the first period.
19086	Hull's shot hit Belfour's rightshoulder, and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line.
19087	Chicago survived the Blues'power play, but the loss of Chelios hurt.
19088	He stopped 12 shots in the second periodand 13 more in the third.
19089	Chicago also hit the goalpost twice.Emerson's goal put the game away.

19094	Are you sayingthat theists claim to not have self control?
19095	I don't think atheists are"dominantly arrogant."
19096	They don't claim some god that has supremacy overall of mankind.

19354	'The most are inside houses.
19355	My stomach isn't-' 'One is a Turkish officer in uniform.
19356	The   man pushed it ajar, then spurred away, leaving me to check on the corpse.
19357	I thought I should, this charge was so constant, so gritted my teeth and   went inside.
19358	All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed.
19359	He was about fifty years old by what  was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye.
19360	The one left slanted,  as with Tartars rather than with Turks.
19361	363 (first paragraph).
19362	'How many people lived there?'
19363	'Oh, about eight hundred.'
19364	'Did you see any Turk officers?'
19365	All were Tartar civilians in mufti.'
19366	"The lieutenant dozed off, then I, but in the small hours a voice woke me -  Dro's.
19367	He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer.
19368	Anyone keelhauled so long and furiously I'd never heard.
19369	Then abruptly Dro broke into  laughter, quick and simple as child's.
19370	Both were a cover for his sense of guilt, I thought, or hoped.
19371	From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....
19372	The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over the carcass of Djul.
19373	'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp.
19374	'But now I must  leave.
19375	'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.'
19376	And  for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains.
19377	A campaign shaped; more raids on Moslem villages."p.
19378	"It will be three hours to take," Dro told me.
19379	We'd close in on three sides.
19380	"That is for morale," Dro put in.
19381	"We must keep the Moslems in terror.
19382	""Soldiers or civilians?"
19383	"There is no difference," said Dro.
19384	"All are armed, in uniform or not.
19385	""But the women and children?
19386	""Will fly with the others as best they may."p.
19387	"The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still.
19388	Hundreds of feet  down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock.
19389	'Djul lies under that,' said  Dro, pointing.
19390	'Our men also attack from the other sides.'
19391	- his whistle lined up all at the rock edge.
19392	Bayonets clicked upon carbines.
19393	Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though  I heard our Utica brass roar.
19394	As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear.
19395	Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.
19396	The came a shrill wailing.
19397	Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke.
19398	Red glimmered about house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs.
19399	A mosque stood in clump of trees, thick and green.
19400	Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.
19401	shouted the gunner by me.
19402	Shots wasted, I thought, when by afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body.
19403	But these shots and the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.
19404	At length all shooting petered out.
19405	I got on my horse and rode down toward Djul.
19406	It burned still but little flame showed now.
19407	The way was steep and  tough, through dense scrub.
19408	Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly, through alders, on smoldering houses.
19409	Across trampled wheat my brothers-in- arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb."p.
19410	361 (fourth paragraph).
19411	"Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair,  large eyes.
19412	She looked about twelve years old.
19413	She lay in some stubble  where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting.
19414	The bayonet  had gone through her back, I judged, for blood around was scant.
19415	Between  the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun  dress.
19416	The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants.
19417	He  lay face down in the path by several huts.
19418	One arm reached out to the  pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough.
19419	Steel had jabbed  just below his neck, into the spine.
19420	There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around.
19421	Djul was  empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking  colonel.
19422	He said all Tartars who had not escaped were dead."p.
19423	"...more stories of Armenian murdering Turks when the czarist troops fled  north.
19424	Turks under Christian rule?
19425	His lips  smacked in irony under the droopy red moustache.
19426	That's bloodshed - just  Smyrna over again on a bigger scale.

20852	If you need CDW's phone number, it's 800-598-4239.
20853	For most applications I findcopy paper fine - still better than dot-matrix.
20854	Can get RAM & FONT cartridges but unlessthe speed of TrueType is a problem I wouldn't bother.
20855	The RAM cartridgescan't be used as buffer - soft fonts only.For graphics, i.e.
20856	BMP images etc the HP can be put into a dither mode viathe HP supplied Win driver.
20857	There a number of dither options such as'scatter', 'pattern' etc.
20858	The manual gives recommendations depending onthe type of image being printed.
20859	Text is not so good in this mode.
20860	Problemarises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text.
20861	This printer is faster, cheaper, and capable of producinglaser-like quality on normal copier paper.
20862	Theintroductory price on the Epson was the same as the HP here in New Zealand.
20863	I absolutely LOVE it.
20864	Most of the stuff I print is either fromMicrosoft Word for Windows or just plain text.
20865	(That is, if you're nearsighted, like me!
20866	:) ) Theprinter comes with its own driver for Windows 3.1!!
20867	I have no othercomplaints.
20868	I bought minefrom a store called CompUSA, and the price now is $340.
20869	I have a friendwho has the HP you are looking at.

20872	Just using> regular copier paper produced fantastic results just in high quality> mode.
20873	I prefer the Deskjet.

20876	I actually thought of some other points after I posted thenote.
20877	The Deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately .5inch aroundthe paper the Bubblejet does not.
20878	Finally, I wanted sheet feeding.
20879	We ended up getting the BubblejetBJ-200 versus the HP.
20880	The BJ-10ex holds only 30 pages, I think.As you can see, up to 100 pages on the BJ-200.
20881	We haven't done anythingbig with the BJ, but its performance seems reasonable under Windows.
20882	The printing quality is a bit better,but you you've got much more possiblities.
20883	Is there a noticeable print quality difference,> particularly in graphics?
20884	Anyway, we areusing Canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well.
20885	I don't print long docs, though.Quality: I think the graphics quality is excellent.
20886	Haven't tried it.Drivers:  No problems under Win3.1 yet.
20887	This is in comparison to the other printers I>mentioned.
20888	I compared it to thesample print of an HP DeskJet 500 and knew that the HP wasn't for me.
20889	TheBJ-200 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality.
20890	I don't have problems with the ink notbeing dry, it seems to dry VERY fast.
20891	Probably within a second.
20892	I'm a little behind in news readingso I know this may be late.
20893	I just purchased the Canon Bubblejet last night.
20894	I was really worriedthat I wouldn't like it but the print quality, and noise level isfantastic!
20895	I printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and itprinted DAMN near laser quality.
20896	You can't tell it's not laser unless youget 2 inches from the page.
20897	no problems with drivers.

20991	It's a question of how long you spend at low RPM and how much you need theextra light.
20992	At low RPM, 3K and under, they don't charge all that much ifat all.

21468	Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe     for the planet Venus.
21469	To accomplish this task, the basic    VENERA design was modified in numerous areas.
21470	VENERA     16 followed suit four days later.
21471	The twin probes thus became Venus'     first polar-circling spacecraft.
21472	Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20     for VENERA 16.
21473	Each strip of information took     eight hours to process by computer.
21474	In planetary terms this makes the Venerean     surface rather young.
21475	This vehicle would map the entire planet in even     finer detail than the VENERAs.
21476	For the time, however, the Soviet     probes maintained that distinction.
21477	Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs.
21478	Nevertheless,     late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true.
21479	This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.
21480	Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar     system.
21481	However, government budget    cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts.
21482	The Soviets' answer to Halley were the VEGAs.
21483	As planned, the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985.
21484	The craft touched the    upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11.
21485	Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had    successfully arrived.
21486	Beneath it was the transmitter, electronics,    and instruments.
21487	Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for    measuring cloud particles.
21488	The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just    north of the equator.
21489	The threat of bursting in the day heat did    not materialize.
21490	The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds.
21491	A large amount of background     infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.
21492	The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2's results    nearly matched its twin.
21493	The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers     instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes.
21494	The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial    bodies with one space vessel.
21495	On June 13, VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for    a two-day fall towards Venus.
21496	After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent     for a further eight hours.
21497	This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed     through the balloon's level.
21498	This rock is rich in     aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.
21499	A high degree     of sulfur was also present in the soil.
21500	VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.
21501	One example was the VESTA mission, planned for    the early 1990s.
21502	The craft     would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon     probes.
21503	Unfortunately for Venus exploration, plans began to change in    the Soviet Union.
21504	By this time in the Soviet space     program interest was focusing on Mars.
21505	Already under construction     was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS.
21506	Two members of this     class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next     year.
21507	PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on    Mars' largest moon, Phobos.
21508	But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars    exploration.
21509	During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change    was taking over the Soviet Union.
21510	These effects hit everywhere, including the space program.
21511	Missions at all levels were cut back.
21512	No nation took them up on the bargain.
21513	Meanwhile the United     States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own.
21514	As a result, Venus became GALILEO's first planetary    goal in February of 1990.
21515	Japan, India, and the ESA have also    considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades.
21516	Final project decisions will be made in 1994.
21517	Humans on Venus              Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus?
21518	Such a project may take centuries    if not millennia.
21519	In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand    Venus as its exists today.
21520	Will Earth ever suffer this fate?
21521	Perhaps Venus holds the answers.

22269	You can always find the latest versionin the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu (18.70.0.226).
22270	Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that willbe looked at by humans.
22271	This means that the image maker can tradeoff file size against output image quality.
22272	(If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, thesize ratio is more like four to one.
22273	If you haveonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantageto you.
22274	Hence JPEG is considerablymore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.
22275	JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit displayhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.
22276	(See section 7 for details.
22277	JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does withoutintroducing visible defects.
22278	This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.
22279	Sharp edges tend tocome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.
22280	You will lose a little image quality if you do.
22281	However, the disk space savings may justifyconverting anyway.
22282	Beprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will notconvert well.
22283	[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?Pretty darn well.
22284	This seems to be a typicalratio for real-world scenes.
22285	There seems to be widespread confusion aboutthe meaning of these settings.
22286	"Quality 95" does NOT mean "keep 95% of theinformation", as some have claimed.
22287	Thissetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in atypical image.
22288	Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.
22289	-Q 2 or so may be amusing as "op art".
22290	OtherJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely differentquality scale.
22291	Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just"high"/"medium"/"low"-style choices.
22292	(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in thesame article.)
22293	It can also do format conversion and some simple imagemanipulations.
22294	It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.
22295	If you prefer not to be on the bleedingedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.
22296	But 2.21 worksfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.
22297	If you just want a simpleimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.
22298	The nextxloadimage release will fix this.)
22299	xli is also free and available fromexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.
22300	This is a good basicviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.
22301	Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are nobigger than your screen.
22302	This is easier toinstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.
22303	It is faster than DVPEG but alittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.
22304	Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see agood JPEG capability in CSHOW.
22305	VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the rightthing with hi-color displays.
22306	Since HSI-formatfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.
22307	Version2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).
22308	This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSIformats) to and from many other image formats.
22309	If you are not physically on MILnet, you shouldexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.

22318	(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0in several ways.
22319	However,some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.

22346	Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current releaseis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.
22347	(This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget toretrieve in binary mode.)
22348	This process is called "color quantization".
22349	(This is somethingof a misnomer, "color selection" would be a better term.
22350	We're stuck withthe standard usage though.
22351	)Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.
22352	Each original color gets "smeared"into a group of nearby colors.
22353	The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.
22354	I occasionally seeposted images described as "256-color JPEG".
22355	)On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to256 or fewer colors.
22356	This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say morethan that here.
22357	If you need help inusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.
22358	[9]  What about lossless JPEG?There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.
22359	There is still a good deal of information loss in thecolor subsampling step.
22360	(With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say"-sample 1x1" to turn off subsampling.
22361	Keep in mind that many commercialJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.
22362	This performs better than JPEGlossless on such images.
22363	* TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.
22364	QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrappedinside the Mac-specific PICT structure.
22365	These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIFformat.
22366	By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed byHSI.
22367	This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not beused for Usenet postings.
22368	Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.
22369	(Thisapplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIFformat by default.
22370	You can tellwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:1.
22371	If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a    "raw JPEG" file.
22372	This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---    it's worth a try, anyway.3.
22373	HSI files start with 'hsi1'.
22374	You're out of luck unless you have HSI    software.
22375	Strip off    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.5.
22376	Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.
22377	If you are    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.
22378	On typical images, arithmetic codingproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.
22379	(All thefile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.
22380	Stay tuned for further details.
22381	Even this is not true; at least, not with the currentfree JPEG software.
22382	It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundofferror.
22383	(It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.
22384	Even such simple changesas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.
22385	Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lotof compression/decompression time this way :-).
22386	You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable qualitywill be *larger* than the GIF.
22387	(So check the sizes too.
22388	While useless, this was nearly free in terms ofstorage cost in GIF files.
22389	Do yourselfa favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.
22390	(If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higherQ setting may not be necessary.
22391	Heavy-handeddithering may require larger smoothing factors.
22392	Too large a smoothing factor will blurthe output image, which you don't want.
22393	I suggest the Supreme Court, or, regionally, theCourts of Appeal.
22394	More specifically, the offices of their Clerks.
22395	Courts already operate substantial record-keeping operations.
22396	Someof these records are confidential.
22397	So judicialcontrol of keys is appropriate.
22398	For the other half of the key, I suggest a unit of Congress, theGeneral Accounting Office.

22999	~ ~  333 Ravenswood Avenue, Menlo Park, CA  94025.
23000	The lives of these wanderershad been unending sadness.
23001	Moses described it as ending each year with asigh (v. 9).
23002	Theforty-year period was finally drawing to an end.
23003	The problem wasthat they were ignorant of the character of their God.
23004	they would have described Him as the God who is Power.
23005	WhenAaron had created their concept of God in an idol.
23006	or youngbull--a symbol of power, of virility.
23007	But when man worships a God of power, His miracles growthin and even boring.
23008	"And a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf.
23009	He mightbe all they need, but then...who knows?
23010	If He has all power, He has a rightto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants.
23011	Hehad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was.
23012	Thisrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God's gloriousPerson.
23013	He had come to know the heart of God as compassion andlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7).
23014	The word "lovingkindness" is not to beunderstood as a human kind of love.
23015	It speaks of the kind of relationshiparising out of the making of a covenant.
23016	It can only be understood as thelove that says, "I will never leave you nor forsake you."
23017	It is a love of covenant commitment and,therefore, operates quite apart from feelings.
23018	If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Himto reject us.
23019	He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- notbecause of who we are.
23020	He willnot let us go.
23021	It issaying to the recipient, "For as long as we shall live, I am for you."
23022	Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will neverleave us nor forsake us.
23023	Tragically, many believers have never seen Him aslove; they see Him as power.
23024	No one will come to faith by just seeingmiracles.
23025	Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in theheart.
23026	He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is tomiss His heart.
23027	He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.
23028	But the power that issues fromlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself.
23029	Suppose we wereto ask, "What has the baby done to deserve this?"
23030	or, "Have arrangementsbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?"
23031	Ourquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral.
23032	He loves us unconditionally,spontaneously.
23033	It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do toearn and deserve that love.
23034	and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy andgladness.
23035	Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with Hislove.
23036	in the Hebrew language.
23037	is a rich picture word describingbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food.
23038	Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to bedrenched in the life-giving love of God.
23039	That sense of satisfaction is thelifelong quest of every man and woman.
23040	But man will always be dissatisfied until he is respondingto the love of the living God.
23041	Only in knowing God's love will the rest of lifemake sense.
23042	I find itfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of Hislove.
23043	Considering the awe with which the people held Moses.
23044	But Moses knewbetter.
23045	God is the only one who can make known to us His love.
23046	We won'tfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use tomanipulate Him.
23047	Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions andgive us God feelings.
23048	It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyesand satisfy us with His love.
23049	This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking Godto make the love He is real in our hearts.
23050	In the history of the early Church,we read of the Holy Spirit "falling upon" the believers.
23051	This is an ancientexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug.
23052	The world, and much of our religious training, has taughtus to perform in order to be accepted.
23053	We come in stillness tothink on and repeat His words of love to our minds.
23054	which have been jadedwith the doctrine of "perform to be accepted."
23055	We begin to realize that Heloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life.
23056	You may notfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS.
23057	I was X-rayed theother day.
23058	I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians keptbehind protective walls.
23059	They know you cannot be exposed to those rayswithout being affected.
23060	So it is as we consciously begin our day knowingthat we are loved.
23061	Such experiential knowledge will produce, according toMoses, "joy and gladness all our days."
23062	Joy is the result of a life that isfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us.
23063	You might saythat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance.

23244	There's some pretty hot stuff in here...Apparently you *didn't* read the whole thing.
23245	>Let's get the government to pay for adoption fees.
23246	Let's get the government >to pay for all the things that make abortion "necessary".
23247	I believe it is wrong, and I >won't pay for it without a gripe.
23248	>You know who's really cleaning up on all this abortion stuff?
23249	You'll have more trouble defining the terms in that statement >than getting people to agree to it.
23250	For example, I perceive I have a right >not to participate in what I feel is murder.
23251	I don't think the government >should, either.
23252	A simplistic explanation is>>that a "person" is a member of society.
23253	Most normal adult human beings are>>good examples of "people".
23254	Most children over two years old are "people" as>>well.
23255	The simple way of determining this is that you can have a conversation>>with them.
23256	Read the thread "Why>>is bodily autonomy so important?"
23257	That needs to be fixed.
23258	It is part of the problem.
23259	If Clinton has a >medical program to get underway, let him address this, too.
23260	It is cheaper >in the long run to save lives; later they will be productive members of >society.
23261	At least, if his plan works...No, they are not guaranteed to become productive members of society.
23262	There is also the matter of the mother.
23263	This is really flawed logic.
23264	It would be like me saying "I was born >with a disfigured face and I want cosmetic repair.
23265	It is >discriminatory that I cannot make that choice, and so you must pay for it."
23266	We *are* footing the bill.
23267	Maybe they willtake choice A.
23268	Maybe they will take choice B.
23269	Maybe they will take choiceC.
23270	They can't afford any *one* of them.
23271	If they take choice A we'd haveto pay them, say $5.
23272	If they take choice B it would cost us $20.
23273	If theytake choice C it will cost us $20 now and a hell of a lot more for the next18 years.
23274	Which one sounds the most realistic for us to be willing to payfor?
23275	Now some people happen not to like choice A.
23276	Other people happennot to like choice C (paying for it, that is).
23277	C has been around and paidfor for years.
23278	Even though it means we spend a lot of money, we can't inconscience refuse to pay for it.
23279	Now A has been around and is perfectlylegal, but it hasn't been funded in the past.
23280	Now A is going to be fundedbut some people object.
23281	They don't like the idea of their tax money goingto pay for choice A.
23282	So we could refuse to fund A at all.
23283	The alternative is to fund A if that iswhat the mother chooses.
23284	We will also still fund B and even C if *that*is what the mother chooses.
23285	(Actually, your taxes are not really going to go down,as I'm sure you would point out.
23286	But the amount that is saved in thatarea can help out in another--like our massive debt.

24072	However, I do not think the Bible makes your case as definitively as you would like it to.
24073	In fact, I don't believe it says anything positive about your case at all.
24074	Therefore, the issue is whether the Bible says homosexual intercourse is a sin.
24075	Most people who accept homosexuality take a radicalapproach to the Law.
24076	They regard all of Lev as not binding onChristians.
24077	It simply means that theirsexual ethics does not come from the Law, and particularly not fromLev.

24319	The head of the pillar was circular.
24320	The lower part    was a little winding.
24321	It was like a monster they told.
24322	They    were little frightened.
24323	Soon the yellowish pillar became    enlarged.
24324	A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle    of the phenomenon.
24325	At last the light landed behind the nearby    forest.
24326	Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were    visible till morning sunrise.
24327	The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in    Lappeenranta.
24328	At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in    the low northeastern horizont.
24329	The altitude of the trail was    only about 3-4 degrees.
24330	Soon the trail began to grow taller.
24331	A loop was appeared in the head of the trail.
24332	It was like a    spoon.
24333	This lasted only 10 seconds.
24334	Now the altitude was about    five degress above horizont.
24335	He noted a bright spot at the    upper stage of loop.
24336	The spot was at magnitude -2.
24337	The loop    became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of    the loop.
24338	A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright    spot.
24339	After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails    were only visible in the low horizont.
24340	Luminous trails were still    visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky.
24341	The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket.
24342	Since 1969    we have observed over 80 rocket phenomena in Finland.
24343	Most of    these are rocket experiments (military missile tests?
24344	), barium    experiments and other chemical releases.

24351	What I'm: asking is what pins does it use (or what are it's specifications?)
24352	I just want: to solder one myself instead of buying one.
24353	I don't even know what port is: used.
24354	: : Help me please (at ke_kimmell@vax.cns.muskingum.edu): : Kevin: : p.s.
24355	I'm intending to use the cable for PC-to-PC transfers (via Lap-Link or: Telix.
24356	Ideas and info gladly accepted.
24357	RS-232 isa commumications specification for communicating between a computer and amodem.
24358	Actually it can be between any end system and any communicationshardware.
24359	The terminology used is Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and DATACommunications Equipment (DCE).
24360	RS-232 spells out the voltage levels, theconnector type, the pinouts, and the signal protocols.
24361	The connector isa "DB-25" but IBM has set an alternative "standard" of DB-9.
24362	DTR is anoutput on the DTE and an input on the DCE.
24363	DSR is an input on the DTE and an output on the DCE.
24364	Ok that'sfive signals; there are only four more of interest.
24365	If the DCE agrees, it sends an okvia the Clear To Send (CTS) signal.
24366	(For completeness, the CTS is an inputto the DTE and an output from the DCE).
24367	The other two signals (of interest)are Ring Indicator (RI) and Data Carrier Detect (DCD).
24368	These are both inputsto the DTE and outputs from the DCE.
24369	the local DCE is talking to some remote DCE.
24370	Ohthere are many other RS-232 signals defined, but they are obsolete.
24371	I haveexplained the nine signals that are on a PC.
24372	There is no DCE to assertthe CTS, DSR, DCD, or RI.
24373	pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the otherend, etc).
24374	It would have to justsend the data and hope it got through.
24375	Therefore a better null modem wouldinclude the DTR/DSR pair crossed.
24376	A particular point a confusion is in thesoftware area.
24377	Just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft-ware will use them.
24378	But if you have a comm.
24379	Theonly thing you can guess reliably is the SG, TD, and RD.
24380	The DTR/DSR is alsofairly common.
24381	There is one more issue that needs to be addressed here.
24382	Andthat is flow control.
24383	And now in the DTE to DTE scenerio, the question is do you need flowcontrol?
24384	The answser is usually.
24385	The problem with hard-ware flow control is that there is no standard.
24386	There are lots of ways todo it and I bet they have all been tried.
24387	One cornerstone of all the methodsis to use the RTS/CTS for one direction.
24388	But beyond that anything is fairgame.
24389	This does not mean adiffernt cable - it is just software.
24390	Specifically I am talking about the DSR.
24391	Shortingthe DTR to the DSR is not a good idea in general but you may find cables likethis.
24392	It is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose.
24393	One more"gotcha" signal is the DCD.
24394	Some software (including the PC BIOS) expects tosee the DCD before it will work.
24395	This signal sometimes gets shorted with theDTR.
24396	Andof course the DTR/DSR are crossed as are the TD/RD and of course the SG mustpass through.
24397	This null modem works with most software.
24398	The flow control,if any, can use the RTS/DCD with the DTR/DSR.
24399	package does notspecify the cable required for PC to PC connection, then I suggest you usethis one.

24743	Jesus is accusing you.> And it is not only you that He is accusing.

24745	We do them regardless.
24746	I think I see where you are coming from Kent.
24747	Jesus doesn't viewguilt like our modern venacular colors it.
24748	"Feelings" have nothing to do with guilt.
24749	Feelings arise from the state of being guilty.
24750	Feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive.
24751	Feelings are a reaction from guilt.
24752	Jesus is talking about the guilt state, not the reaction.
24753	Let me give you an example:Have you ever made a mistake?
24754	Have you ever lied to someone?
24755	Even alittle white lie?
24756	Have you ever claimed to know something that you really didn't know?
24757	Have you ever hated someone?
24758	Have you ever been selfish?Are you guilty of any one of these?
24759	The answer is of course, YES.
24760	That is it what Jesus is getting at.
24761	Feelings do not even enter the picture.
24762	The Bible calls it the state that we are all sinners.
24763	Even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our guilt that we are all sinners.
24764	It is it in our nature to do bad things.
24765	We are sinners, therefore we do bad things.
24766	Being a sinner is fact.
24767	It isnot a pleasant fact.
24768	But it is just a fact.
24769	Calling ussinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you ahuman being.
24770	This the way Jesus does NOT want us to deal with it.
24771	Jesus is in the business of showing us how much heloves us despite our guilt.
24772	Jesus knows we are guilty.
24773	Thatisn't new to him.
24774	It is no big deal to him.
24775	Why, because he wants to have your company.
24776	You cannot fit a square peg intoa round hole.
24777	The Holy Spirit willmove it.
24778	The benefits of this are endless.
24779	Forwith the divine nature living within us, we can now seeour imperfections better.
24780	We can now head them off at the pass.
24781	Because the divine nature now lives within us, we now have authority over demonic forces.
24782	And what did Jesus say?
24783	"Depart from me, for I never *knew* you."
24784	That is the cornerstone of Christianity, Kent.
24785	Jesus must know you as his friend.
24786	It is your relationship to Jesus.
24787	It shows that you have a strong self-image--that youlove yourself.
24788	That is the second greatest commandment Jesustaught.
24789	If only more people could do as you do.
24790	You have stated what Jesus said.
24791	"Come to me,take my yoke upon your shoulders, for my burden is light."
24792	A yokeis used to direct oxen to do work.
24793	Once you have a relationship with Jesus, you and him share the yoke and the burdens of life.
24794	Having God at your side is of great advantage.

24866	1979 was a fineyear; 78 and 80 were merely really good.

24872	It just happened that Saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid.
24873	Possibly, if 200,000 Iraqis had indeed died, but this number is based onGreenpeace estimates.

24875	I'veincluded an article I recently posted below, but this is really oldnews.
24876	The favored image of the hysterics is the last battle of the war atMutla'.
24877	Thedestruction of the Iraqi convoy at Mutla' was portrayed as an all-outslaughter.
24878	This is simply not true.
24879	Before bombers came back, most of the rest of the Iraqi soldiers fledon foot.
24880	Furthermore, your estimates of Kuwaiti war dead if Allies hadn't invadedis completely ridiculous.
24881	You have acknowledged (certainly implicitly)  that Saddam is a barbarous brute.
24882	Yet, when itcomes to his treatment of Kuwaitis, he is an angel.
24883	In your estimate,he would've killed *fewer* than he already had when the war started.

24886	Now, one former DIA analyst says the number of Iraqi troops killed mayhave been as low as 1,500.
24887	Heidenrich is not the first to question the Iraqi death toll numbers that originally were aired.
24888	On Monday, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Cmdr.
24889	Joe Gradisherreiterated past statements that "there just isn't a number," that is credible.
24890	It estimated that 5,000 to 15,000 Iraqi civilians were also killed.
24891	But as more information became available, those figures gradually were revised downward.
24892	"Maybe the figures are too low," he wrote.
24893	"Maybe the real death tollon the battlefield was 2,000 or 3,000 or even 6,000.
24894	Even then, the evidencesuggests a death toll of well below 100,000 -- or even 10,000."

25190	It is a no-brainer.While I agree that Lemieux deserves the Hart, it is far from a "no-brainer".
25191	The Hart trophy goes to the player most valuable to his team, not to the bestplayer in the league.

28494	Faith is a possible response to hearing God's word preached.

28498	"The way to please God is to repent and get a new heart and spirit.
28499	Death came toeach man because each man sinned.
28500	Note that it's good to read through allof Romans 5:12-21.
28501	"Through the disobedience of each individual, each was made a sinner.
28502	All that David is saying here is that he can'tremember a time when he wasn't sinful.
28503	He is humbling himself before Godby confessing his sinfulness.
28504	His saying that he was sinful at birth isa hyperbole.

28508	Jesus certainly couldn't have had less knowledge than normal humanbabies.
28509	We see thathe did grow and become wiser in Luke 2:40 and 2:52.
28510	The implication isthat Jesus did wrong things as a child before he knew to choose right overwrong.
28511	And there are certainly groups that baptize infantswithout believing in original sin.
28512	Among Protestants, the sacramentstend to be a bit more symbolic than among Catholics.

28623	Somehow I've managed to delete my vitamin A post from my text file.
28624	Big mistake(in my opinion).
28625	Both retinol and beta-carotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present(60-80%).
28626	A normal human adult liver should have 500,000IU to 1,000,000IU of retinol stored.
28627	We are born with 10,000IU in our liver.
28628	For adult feamles its 800 RE or 4,000IU of vitamin A.
28629	That report and it's recommendations was killed.
28630	Concern over the increasing supplementation was the main reason.
28631	RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease, not to keep nutrient reserves full.
28632	The normal range of serum retinol will be 20-100ug/dl.
28633	The body uses vitamin A(retinol) for many different things.
28634	Infection and cancer protection uses retinoic acid.
28635	If you increase your intake of vitamin C, you will increase your formation of retinoic acid.
28636	The mucus membrane is referred to as the "first line" defense against infection.
28637	Cancer has two distinct steps, DNA alteration and cell promotion.
28638	For cells that normally divide all the time, promoters are not that important.
28639	The normal range for vitamin A content for a child is 20 to 90ug/dl.
28640	Lower values are indicators of deficiency or depleted body stores.
28641	Serum levels greater than 100ug/dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin A.
28642	Their toxic serum retinol level is very conservative.
28643	If they want to get more agressive, fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol.
28644	The dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is 18,000IU of retinol per day.
28645	Yes but the effect will take a long time to develop.
28646	My advise is to use retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta-carotene to keep it full.
28647	Vitamin A is probably one nutrient that is better off left to prescription by doctors.
28648	But when we have the M.D.

28958	* XView and OLIT will be supported, but probably not enhanced after the      next release.
28959	I don't know if there will be a source release of      XView 3.1 or not.
28960	* The COSE Environment will include at least some of Sun's DeskSet,      ported to Motif.

28962	OPEN LOOK is a specification of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
28963	See Also:Bibliography@ What is OpenWindows?
28964	It comes from Sun and also with System V Release 4 from certain vendors.
28965	@ What are OLIT, XView and TNT?
28966	See the Bibliography    for documentation on the individual toolkits.
28967	You could buy the source from AT&T,    although you didn't get the same version tht Sun ship.
28968	Sun includes the    OLIT library in OpenWindows (q.v.
28969	); it is also often included in    System V Release 4.
28970	It was written in C.  The release of OLIT in    OpenWindows 3.0 was OLIT 3.0.
28971	There's even a shell script to help    migrate source code from SunView to XView.
28972	XView is often said to be    the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with X Windows.
28973	The current version of XView from Sun is 3.0.
28974	XView *will* be    included in the next release of OpenWindows, unlike NeWS.
28975	It's currently included in OpenWindows.
28976	Sun currently asserts that it is committed to OLIT, however.
28977	@ Where does Motif fit in?
28978	It will be part of System V    Release 4.2.
28979	Contact: Joanne Newbauer, jo@usl.com, (908) 522-6677@ What about that Display PostScript thing?
28980	It is not like ATM on a PC in this regard.
28981	They are window managers.
28982	A window manager is the part of the X Window    system (e.g.
28983	Olwm is the standard OPEN LOOK window manager.
28984	It's included with all of the OpenWindows (q.v.)
28985	implementations, and    you can also get the source by ftp, since Sun donated it.
28986	Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a `virtual desktop' (hence the    `v' in its name).
28987	You can    move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys.
28988	@ Can I use my favorite window manager with OpenWindows instead of olwm?
28989	The OpenWindows xnews server combines SunView, NeWS (PostScript) and X11.
28990	This means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems.
28991	This includes    pageview in particular.
28992	OLIT or XView ones)    will work perfectly well.
28993	You may find that you get complaints about    fonts not being found.
28994	If so, see the Fonts section below.
28995	Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib (normally /usr/openwin/lib) for these files    without the leading .
28996	and copy any you want to change.
28997	You may need    to edit your .xinitrc to get them recognized.
28998	Note that .openwin-sys is not executed unless you edit .xinitrc.
28999	.Xdefaults    You can put X Windows resource specifications in here.
29000	Don't put comments in .Xdefaults, since `props' deletes them.
29001	This is documented in the NeWS programming manual, near the    back.
29002	WARNING: things in this file rarely work on both OpenWindows 2 and 3.
29003	Note that this may increase the amount of memory used    by the NeWS server (xnews) dramatically.
29004	See also "man 7 xview" for a list of    keybindings you can change, at least for XView programs.
29005	Run screenblank from /etc/rc.local if you can; it's a boring but    effective screen saver.
29006	See `man screenblank'.
29007	Under Solaris 2 you'll need to copy screenblank from an older system, as    it's not supplied.
29008	No need to use COPY    * Move to the XTerm window and press ADJUST (the middle mouse button).
29009	* You can also use the COPY/CUT and PASTE buttons.
29010	@ COPY/PASTE is boring.
29011	What short-cuts are available?
29012	You'll see that it's underlined      or crossed out, as appropriate.
29013	(In the jed demo it goes grey)    * Let go of the PASTE (or CUT) button.
29014	* The text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret.
29015	@ What are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere?
29016	See the man page for textedit(1) for some of them.
29017	In general, the editing/moving commands go in the opposite direction when    shifted - e.g.

29022	@ Is there a tty-based interface to cm (Calendar Manager)?
29023	Yes, cm_delete, cm_insert and cm_lookup; these all have manual pages.
29024	@ How can I arrange to have my .signature included in my outgoing mail?
29025	The best way is:    $ cd    $ cp /usr/lib/.textswrc .
29026	Yes, under either Solaris 2.0 or 2.1 (I'm not sure which).
29027	Or, Not Yet, in other words.
29028	If you have FrameMaker there is a utility to import them, I'm told.
29029	Documentation on    the unbundled version of TypeScaler is also available from Sun OpenFonts.
29030	You can buy F3 fonts from SunPICS, Monotype, Linotype, URW and probably    other major foundries.
29031	SunPICS' NeWSPrint software supports Type 1 fonts.

29033	You need to say psh -i    so that the PostScript packages are loaded - see the psh man page.
29034	@ Converting between font formats (convertfont, etc.)
29035	$OPENWINHOME should be /usr/openwin on most systems.
29036	These messages all come from SunView programs.
29037	SunView was an    earlier windowing system for Suns, and was not networked.
29038	You almost    certainly want to run the programs in $OPENWINHOME instead.
29039	@ Cut Copy and Paste don't work at all (OpenWindows only)    Oh dear.

29044	Also, seethe note about contool, above.
29045	@ Is there an easy way of editing .Xdefaults?
29046	Use `props', which appears in the default root menu as `properties'.

29053	is to use xterm instead of cmdtool.
29054	@ Why don't flat check-boxes work?
29055	A known bug may make Guide's output dump core if you use these.
29056	This applies only to versions of DevGuide before Devguide 3.0.
29057	@ When I leave OpenWindows, my screen goes blank or my mouse cursor stays  on the screen.
29058	@ When I use snapshot, the system crashes, or the server hangs, or something.
29059	This was a bug related to some systems only.
29060	The only work-round was to    use some other screen dump program, such as xwd, xv 2.21 or xgrabsc.
29061	@ Why have some of my function keys stopped working?
29062	Put the X11 binaries in (for example) /usr/bin/X11.
29063	Set OPENWINHOME to the directory containing OpenWindows if it isn't    /usr/openwin.
29064	See Also:Environment Variables (especially XFILESEARCHPATH).
29065	Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib/OSpatches    and install the patch.

29077	Use /etc/setsid to start your command tools and all will be well.
29078	@ how do I set the font of individual Scrolling List items?
29079	PANEL_LIST_FONT takes an int row_number and an Xv_opaque font_handle.
29080	PANEL_LIST_FONTS take a NULL terminated list of Xv_opaque font_handles.
29081	There is no easy way to make an entire list fixed width font.
29082	@ how do I keep an XView pop-up window displayed after a button is pressed?

29254	There exist several usenet FAQ archive sites.
29255	The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].
29256	This document  can be found there in /pub/usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups.
29257	Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates  on performance.
29258	The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with  regards to the X server.
29259	The gist of that topic seems to be:"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4".
29260	If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.
29261	*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.
29262	eg: via a call to plock().
29263	Does this help  performance at all?
29264	I am not in a position to give it a try.
29265	This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!
29266	A lot of initialization is done by    the server when it starts.
29267	This process touches a large number of    pages.
29268	All this activity is typically memory intensive.
29269	Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded  into the server.
29270	This will also conserve server resources, since fewer  fonts will be loaded by the server.
29271	Twm's default font is 8x13.
29272	Since  I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.
29273	Saves RAM and saves    on server startup time.
29274	For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.
29275	So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from    .../app-defaults/XTerm.
29276	Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,    and so on and so forth.
29277	Note that not all clients follow the same    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.
29278	This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).
29279	Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]
29280	- Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER      property.
29281	- xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.
29282	I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped      out.
29283	The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g.
29284	- You may also run into some clients which break the rules.
29285	Hopefully MIT  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.
29286	In the meantime, if  you want to try it yourself, email Jody.
29287	Think also  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.
29288	For example:  Is there  a smaller clock program than xclock?
29289	I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject  of X client programs.
29290	The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.
29291	That is, try  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif  clients, etc).
29292	If you use more than one, then you're dragging in  more than one toolkit library.
29293	Extensively configurable.
29294	| ...  +-----  Ugly maybe, but at my site it's still the most used.
29295	I suspect that  xterm is one of the most used clients at many, if not most sites.
29296	Isn't there a better terminal emulator available?
29297	If you must use xterm, you can try reducing the number of saveLines  to reduce memory usage.
29298	This was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm.
29299	You don't have to   rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.
29300	In it's current   version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.
29301	I've heard that   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any   yet.
29302	He   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.
29303	So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of   xvt over xterm.
29304	Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.
29305	If you can provide some hard data, I'd like to see it.
29306	"I also have my own terminal emulator.
29307	Its major lack is   scrollback, but some people like it anyway.
29308	Examining the what was    going on with xscope I found it.
29309	The user    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.
29310	This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots  of areas.

29316	"xset m 3 10 &""  System Default (Un-Accelerated)"!
29317	"xset m default &""  Glacial"!
29318	Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.
29319	- Better yet, don't use Motif at all.
29320	It's an absolute pig.
29321	- Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.
29322	(This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)
29323	- Use a line width of 0 in GCs.
29324	On some servers this makes a HUGE      difference.
29325	- Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.
29326	This can make the      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable      one.

30944	This is an act against our world of civilization.
30945	mainly of women and children.
30946	This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers who had remained in the rear during the war.
30947	It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and traps.
30948	The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds and withdrew.
30949	The  Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear also.
30950	The incidents of murder and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.
30951	The Commander in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.
30952	...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief, Odishelidge.
30953	Large holes were dug and the defenceless  Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes.
30954	Later, the murdered Turks were thrown into the holes.
30955	Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw towards Erzurum...
30956	When the Russian soldiers heard the cries of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them.
30957	All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with hatred and loathing.
30958	The Kurd fell down but did not die.
30959	The Armenian attempted to force the stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd.
30960	Their heads had been cut off by axes.
30961	He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered children.
30962	Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and spat on the corpses.
30963	Among these corpses were men and women of every age, children and old people.
30964	The women's bodies had obvious marks of rape.
30965	The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.
30966	The lieutenant colonel had severely reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour.
30967	They had cut out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head.
30968	The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7...
30969	The enlisted men  of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people.
30970	Then they took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts.
30971	100 people among this group were able to save their lives as the result of my decisive attempts.
30972	Today, some Turks were murdered on the streets.
30973	On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent Moslems.
30974	The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were threatened with death.
30975	Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for murdering an innocent Turk.
30976	In Erzurum, the  Armenians burned down the Turkish market.
30977	However no result was achieved.
30978	In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a natural silence.
30979	The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed one by one.
30980	The number of murders committed on that night reached three thousand.
30981	It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details of the massacre.
30982	The leading Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.
30983	However, such people were only a minority.
30984	Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian cause.
30985	Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have supported the massacres secretly.
30986	Some, on the other hand, preferred to remain silent.
30987	You can never understand the Armenian cause.'
30988	The Armenians had a conscience.
30989	They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear of the Turkish soldiers.
30990	Nothing which is already done can be undone.

31004	He finds"homosexuals" unacceptable as a translation because it is anachronistic.
31005	What is this "disjunction"?
31006	He bases it on historical and linguisticfacts.
31007	Virtually all forms of behavior, except transvestism, were acceptable.
31008	Christianity simply added the categories of "natural" and "unnatural" indescribing these actions.
31009	Consequently the translation isinaccurate because it "includes celibate homophiles,.
31010	incorrectly exludesheterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts .
31011	[and]incorrectly includesfemale homosexuals" (19=89).
31012	The foregoing clarifies why Petersen feels that the translatio"homosexual" is mistaken.
31013	The nextphases of this paper will critically examine Petersen's position.
31014	The following discussion will show why neither ofthese positions is legitimate.
31015	Is it only a modern phenomenon?
31016	He discounts this, however, believing that evenhere "acts appear to be the deciding factor."
31017	[24]   Plato posits a third sexcomprised of a maile-female (androgynon ("man-woman").
31018	Hence "original nature"palai physis, consisted of three kinds of human beings.
31019	Several observations about this text are in order.
31020	Lesbianism iscontemplated, as will as male homosexuality (191e).
31021	"Natural interest" (tonnoun physei), (192b) refelects modern concepts of propensity or inclination.
31022	Clearly the ancients thought of love (homosexual or other) apart fromactions.
31023	bring reproach (182e-183a, 184b).
31024	They mention the need to love the soul not the body (183e).
31025	There are towkinds of love in the body (186b) and each has its "desire" and "passion"(186b-d).
31026	This isthe object of desire and love.
31027	Socrates clearly distinguishes between "whatsort of being is love" and the "works" of love (201e).
31028	His wors have significance for more than pederasty.
31029	Widespread evidence to the contray supports thelatter.
31030	InRom 1:21-28 such phrases as "reasoning," "heart," "becoming foolish," "desiresof the heart."
31031	Habits betray what people are within, as also the Lord Jesus taught (cf.
31032	The inner condition is as important as the outer act; one gives riseto the other (cf.
31033	Petersen errs regarding other particulars too.
31034	Transvestism apparentlywas accepted by the ancients.
31035	[28]  Only afew moralist and Jewish writers are on record as condemning it.
31036	Even the OT forbade the interchangeof clothing between the sexes  (Deut 22:5).
31037	Plato, the TEST.NAPH., Philo, Josephu,Plutarch, and others used these words or related concepts.

31060	Sean O'Casey in _The White Plague_ by Frank Herbert.
31061	As you know, the President jogged this morning with Senator Wofford.
31062	At 1:30 p.m., he will meet with his principal advisors on Bosnia.
31063	And at 5:00 p.m., he'll meet with President Vaclav Havel.
31064	There will be a photo op at the top of that meeting; no formal press conference afterwards.
31065	Q  Is he moving towards some major decision this week on Bosnia?
31066	MS. MYERS:  As we've said, he's continuing to discuss his options.
31067	He'll try to contact President Mitterrand again today, and he'll continue to discuss it.
31068	We don't have any specific timetable, but obviously the situation there is very serious.
31069	Q  Has he called Janet Reno today or yesterday?
31070	MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he's spoken to her today.
31071	He answered a question about it yesterday.
31072	Q  Before anything had happened.
31073	MS. MYERS:  Before anything happened.
31074	He put out --          Q  Since something has happened he's had nothing to say.
31075	MS. MYERS:  He's put out a statement on it last night.
31076	And we'll have more to say about it later today.
31077	Q  In what forum is that going to be?
31078	MS. MYERS:  It will be at the photo in the Rose Garden.
31079	Q  He will talk about Waco at that?
31080	MS. MYERS:  Yes, he'll have something to say.
31081	Q  Is that something we can take live?
31082	MS. MYERS:  I think it will be brief.
31083	We can talk a little later about the exact structure as we work it out.
31084	But I don't know if it's something you'd want to take live.
31085	Q  Will he take questions on Waco at that time as well?
31086	MS. MYERS:  He'll probably take a few.
31087	Q  Is there any reason why he hasn't talked to the Attorney General?
31088	MS. MYERS:  I'll have to double-check.
31089	I don't know that he hasn't talked to her this morning.
31090	Q  And she didn't come here this morning to see him or anyone else?
31091	Q  And he didn't talk yesterday?
31092	Q  What's the reaction to her resignation statement that she made last night?
31093	MS. MYERS:  She was asked a question about it, and she answered the question.
31094	The President has absolutely no intention of asking for the Attorney General's resignation.
31095	He stands behind her 100 percent.
31096	As you know, he was informed about the decision.
31097	He takes full responsibility for that, and stands 100 percent behind Attorney General Reno.
31098	He raised no objections.
31099	He supports her decision to go forward with it.
31100	He was fully briefed.
31101	MS. MYERS:  I think everybody feels bad when life is lost.
31102	But I don't think that that is reason to second-guess the decision.
31103	He stands behind the decision that was made.
31104	He was informed about it.
31105	It's a difficult operation and there's -- it had already gone on for more than seven weeks.
31106	Four federal agents had lost their lives in the line of duty -- let's not forget that.
31107	This was a very difficult situation and all the decisions involved were very difficult.
31108	They thought, given the circumstances, it was the best possible course of action.
31109	There's just no point in second-guessing those decisions.
31110	Now, I think that there's a reason --          Q  Why not?
31111	They have to --          MS. MYERS:  No, not to second-guess the decisions.
31112	I think it's important to take a look at it, to have an investigation.
31113	I think the President will talk some about that later today.
31114	But at this -- from this vantage point, to second-guess those decisions, it's not useful.
31115	Q  He will order an investigation?
31116	MS. MYERS:  He'll have more -- yes -- he'll have more to say about an investigation.
31117	Q  What kind of investigation?
31118	MS. MYERS:  He'll have more to say about it later.
31119	You can't say that we did the best we could when it turned out to be a rather -- a debacle.
31120	I don't think anybody disputes that the outcome was tragic.
31121	Q  What was the FBI Director's role in this?
31122	MS. MYERS:  Well, he was obviously involved in setting up the operation.
31123	He signed off on it, as did the agents that were on the ground that were working with him.
31124	I don't believe he spoke to the President, but I'll double-check that.
31125	Q  But he was very closely involved in every aspect of planning and so forth?
31126	MS. MYERS:  I would refer you to the FBI on exactly what aspects he was involved with.
31127	Q  Will Janet Reno be coming over to the White House today?
31128	MS. MYERS:  There's no planned meeting.
31129	I don't believe that she'll be here.
31130	Q  She won't be at this event at 1:15 p.m.?
31131	MS. MYERS:  No, no plans to be.
31132	And I think it's most tragic that a lot of innocent children lost their lives in this.
31133	I don't think anybody disputes the tragedy of the outcome.
31134	So who --          MS. MYERS:  There were people talking on a staff-to-staff level.
31135	But who at the Justice Department was handling that for Reno?
31136	Who was talking to the White House?
31137	MS. MYERS:  There were a number of people.
31138	There were a number of people at a number of different levels involved.
31139	Q  Did Webb Hubbell talk to the President?
31140	MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.
31141	I don't know if he talked -- he may have at one point.
31142	MS. MYERS:  Again, I don't know if he's talked to her this morning.
31143	Again, he's kept fully aware of what has been going on throughout the day.
31144	He stands 100 percent behind her decisions.
31145	Q  But wouldn't he want to convey those thoughts to her personally yesterday?
31146	MS. MYERS:  One more time, I don't know if they've spoken this morning.
31147	Q  Clearly there's a perception that she was left hung out to dry all day yesterday.
31148	MS. MYERS:  That's just not true.
31149	The President stands foursquare behind the Attorney General on this.
31150	He accepts full responsibility for the events that transpired.
31151	I don't know what else he can say to show that he supports her 1,000 percent.
31152	Q  One of the best indications of that is to pick up the phone and tell her.
31153	MS. MYERS:  Again, I don't know whether they've spoken this morning.
31154	Q  Why can't we find out?
31155	MS. MYERS:  Well, we can.
31156	I can't do it standing here right now.
31157	Q  You've got six people here.
31158	All they've got to do is pick up the phone.
31159	MS. MYERS:  Helen, we'll get back to you.
31160	MS. MYERS:  I think that they discussed the situation.
31161	Q  Dee Dee, the President yesterday morning said it was entirely her decision.
31162	She then said that she told him what was happening and he said, okay.
31163	Does the President regard it that he gave the go-ahead or that she gave the go-ahead?
31164	She informed him about that and he raised no objections.
31165	Again, I don't know how much clearer we can be about that.
31166	Q  And he said, okay.
31167	The issue is over the responsibility.
31168	MS. MYERS:  He said, okay.
31169	Q   Does okay mean --     MS. MYERS:  The President accepts ultimate responsibility.
31170	Q  It would be internal -- is it meant to preclude any congressional investigation?
31171	MS. MYERS:  No, it's meant simply to follow up on the incidents that occurred yesterday.
31172	MS. MYERS:  To the best of our ability.
31173	Q  Dee Dee, there are two reports out this morning.
31174	MS. MYERS:  He's been briefed.
31175	I don't think that they've gotten into the compound yet.
31176	They were still waiting for it to cool off.
31177	I don't think there's much beyond what's been reported in the news accounts.
31178	But he has been kept up-to-date on it.
31179	MS. MYERS:  He believes that she made -- he stands behind the decision that she made.
31180	Q  What about the validity of the decisions made on the ground?
31181	Does he back those --          MS. MYERS:  He's not going to second-guess decisions made.
31182	Q  Dee Dee, you just said, he stands behind the decision which she made.
31183	Normally, in a situation like this, the President says, I  made the decision.
31184	But you're saying she made the decision?
31185	MS. MYERS:  I'm saying that the President was briefed about the decision.
31186	He okayed it and he accepts full responsibility for it.
31187	That is how the chain of command works.
31188	The operation went forward, and the President accepts full responsibility.
31189	Q  In that chain of command analogy there, I want to go back to Sessions a moment.
31190	What was his involvement?
31191	Q  Does the President stand behind Director Sessions?
31192	He fully supports the Attorney General in this.
31193	As you know, the Director of the FBI reports to the Attorney General.
31194	The Attorney General made the decision.
31195	She informed the President about those decisions.
31196	He didn't raise any objections to it, and he accepts full responsibility.
31197	MS. MYERS:  I just don't think that had anything to do with it.
31198	I think the agents on the ground -- the operation went forward.
31199	I'm not going to speculate on that.
31200	She was carrying forward her responsibility to inform the public about the events of yesterday.
31201	I think she did a very admirable job.
31202	The President agrees with that.
31203	Q  Before Sunday, how often was the President briefed on the situation in Waco?
31204	MS. MYERS:  He was kept updated on a regular basis, on a daily basis.
31205	Q  Who briefed the President?
31206	He has daily briefings on a number of issues.
31207	MS. MYERS:  He's briefed regularly by a White House staff on a number of issues.
31208	Again, I'm not going to get into exactly who briefs him on what subjects.
31209	Q  On another subject.
31210	Q  Now we're going to do gays in the military.
31211	MS. MYERS:  I welcome it.
31212	Q  How close are you to signing the biodiversity treaty?
31213	MS. MYERS:  As you know, the President's giving a speech on Earth Day tomorrow.
31214	We'll have more to say about it then.
31215	Q  Any details on where or when that speech is yet?
31216	MS. MYERS:  It's at 11:30 a.m. and I don't know where yet.
31217	Q  Dee Dee, is this a major policy address?
31218	How would you characterize the speech tomorrow?
31219	MS. MYERS:  I would characterize it as a Earth Day speech.
31220	I wouldn't look for any major departures from his past positions on these things.
31221	But, again, I don't want to get too much into what he's going to talk about tomorrow.
31222	Q  Is this at a location outside the White House?
31223	MS. MYERS:  It will be somewhere in Washington.
31224	We don't know exactly where yet.
31225	MS. MYERS:  Only Prime Minister Major.
31226	And again, he'll try to reach President Mitterrand again this morning.
31227	Does the administration still believe that it can work and that they will sign on?
31228	As you know, the administration is considering a wide variety of options at this point.
31229	The situation there in and around Srebrenica and the rest of Eastern Bosnia is quite serious.
31230	And the President will meet with his Bosnian advisors today and continue to press forward on this.
31231	MS. MYERS:  Again, they'll be reviewing a number of options, including the peace plan.
31232	Q  Does the group that he's meeting with today include Reg Bartholomew?
31233	MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he's here.
31234	But it will be among the usual -- Secretary Christopher, Secretary Aspin, General Powell.
31235	MS. MYERS:  No, I don't.
31236	I'll get back to you on that.
31237	Q  As a group, or one by one?
31238	MS. MYERS:  I believe it's as a group.
31239	But he will meet with all of the foreign heads of state that are here.
31240	Q  Dee Dee, has the President decided whether he supports the gay and lesbian civil rights act?
31241	And has anything been worked out for him to address the march on Sunday?
31242	MS. MYERS:  I think he'll probably have a letter or some kind of a statement to the march.
31243	We haven't worked out the exact details of that.
31244	Q  Not a live phone hook-up?
31245	MS. MYERS:  Probably not, given the logistics of getting to Boston.
31246	The speech, as you know, is at 4:00 p.m.
31247	The answer to the other part of your question is, no, he hasn't taken a position on it.
31248	Q  You said that speech in Boston was at 4:00 p.m.?
31249	MS. MYERS:  I believe so, yes.
31250	Q  Do you know what it's on?
31251	When will he be meeting with the President?
31252	MS. MYERS:  No specific meeting is scheduled.
31253	We'll talk to him at some point and see.
31254	We look forward to his report, but exactly how he'll make that report is unclear.
31255	Q  So he's not going to come immediately to the White House?
31256	Q  The AIDS czar -- how close are you?
31257	MS. MYERS:  Still working on it.
31258	Q  Do you expect it before the march?
31259	MS. MYERS:  I don't have a time line on it.
31260	Q  Did the President ask Senator Mitchell to try the Lloyd Cutler ploy to break the filibuster?
31261	MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.
31262	MS. MYERS:  He's just not going to.
31263	Q  Are Senate Democrats here at this hour?
31264	We'll continue to talk.
31265	The President is committed to some kind of a jobs package; we'd like to see it passed.
31266	And we'll continue in conversations throughout the day and see where we end up.
31267	MS. MYERS:  We'll be happy to.
31268	Q  It's become a pressing question for the last several hours.
31269	Q  Does he have an opinion on Hatfield?
31270	MS. MYERS:  I mean, obviously, he prefers -- he offered a compromise package of $12.2 billion.
31271	Q  Dee Dee, is there any White House official that will be at the march on Sunday?
31272	MS. MYERS:  Somebody will be there representing the President.
31273	I don't know who yet.
31274	Q  Well, has it been decided how he's going to address?
31275	Is it going to be a videotape or a phone call?
31276	Q  The official will read the letter, is that what it sounds like?
31277	Q  Lloyd Bentsen came in here this morning.
31278	Do you know what was that about?
31279	Was that about this Waco thing?
31280	MS. MYERS:  No, actually it wasn't.
31281	It may have come up, but it was about economic issues.
31282	Q  On health care -- is the 17th of May still the target?
31283	MS. MYERS:  That's still the target.
31284	I wouldn't rule that out as an option, but no decisions have been made.

31365	First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than   realistic.
31366	I pulled out a copy of "2001: A Space Odyssey" that I had recorded off TV   a while back.
31367	I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between   frames.
31368	Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.
31369	That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short   test movie.
31370	This time the playback rate   was only about 35 frames per second.
31371	This time the playback speed was over 60 fps.
31372	A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was   very jerky.
31373	Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with   ease.
31374	A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see   any evidence of stutter.
31375	Image sizeis, of course, another biggie.

31385	Mypoint is that last year the Sharks had toughness that was missingthis year.
31386	Whether it's a cheap shot or not youcan't let the other teams push you around.
31387	The 1992-93 Sharkssimply got pushed around to much.
31388	Other teams knew this.They knew they could aggressively check the Sharks and notpay for it.
31389	Q  If you'll give us the time.
31390	Q  We've got a two-minute warning problem.
31391	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, it is a problem.
31392	I think that's the best way to handle it.
31393	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sure.
31394	They had a good discussion, about 15 minutes.
31395	The Attorney General informed the President of what she wanted to do.
31396	He raised no objections.
31397	Obviously, she had the implicit authority from the President to go forward.
31398	He raised no objections.
31399	They had a discussion of a general nature about the incident.
31400	Again, yesterday morning around 11:00 a.m., the President spoke with the Attorney General again.
31401	They had a brief discussion over what was happening in Waco.
31402	As you know, this was before the fire broke out at the compound.
31403	And I think that was why there was some -- just some confusion.
31404	They were informing us of their decisions, what they would like to do.
31405	There was an FBI briefing in Waco.
31406	The Attorney General had her press conference.
31407	The President then issued a statement after that.
31408	He spoke with the Attorney General again yesterday evening.
31409	Q  At what hour was that?
31410	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It was quite late.
31411	I believe it was after he returned from the Holocaust Museum.
31412	He took a tour of the Holocaust Museum last night.
31413	Q  And he went out to dinner.
31414	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe briefly.
31415	Yes, he went to dinner and then he spoke with the Attorney General last night.
31416	I don't know the exact time; I think it was relatively late.
31417	As you know, the President will have an announcement to make at 1:15.
31418	Q  Did he ever talk with Webb Hubbell yesterday, last night, or this morning?
31419	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge, no.
31420	Q  Was Webb Hubbell the point man for the White House?
31421	The Attorney General was running the operation.
31422	Q  Did he tell her that she should sleep well, that she had done a good job?
31423	Or he just tell her that she should get some sleep?
31424	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think sleep well -- done a good job -- I don't know the exact words.
31425	I think that sounds right.
31426	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's the spirit -- no, it has nothing to do with that.
31427	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- it was just speaking of warm words to a friend.
31428	Q  Does he think the situation was mishandled?
31429	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President --          Q  In retrospect?
31430	He accepts full responsibility.
31431	Q  How much did he know about what she was going to go ahead with?
31432	I know that she made the case to him -- explained --outlined the case for action.
31433	Did she say to him on Sunday precisely what action?
31434	I think that they had a general discussion about the action, about the advisability of action.
31435	Is it, "we're going to use tear gas"?
31436	I mean, we were in close contact with the Justice Department.
31437	The President accepts responsibility for this.
31438	It is the responsibility of those on the ground to make recommendations.
31439	The Attorney General has operational control over this.
31440	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know the specific questions.
31441	He had general questions about how the decision was going about being made.
31442	Q  Those are general questions and did he ask generally, why now?
31443	I don't know if he asked the question, "why now?  "
31444	I don't know if he asked that specific question.
31445	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I'm not certain how much specific detail they got into.
31446	Again, I do not know how precisely detailed it was beyond that.
31447	Q  What is the President's understanding why yesterday?
31448	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  This is the first I've heard.
31449	I think what we can go to is what the FBI and the Attorney General has said.
31450	There were indications that those inside the compound were at some danger.
31451	All of these factors came into play.
31452	I would just go back to what the Attorney General has said.
31453	You have to make the best judgment you can, given the information you have at the time.
31454	Obviously, we all regret the loss of life.
31455	It's a terribly unfortunate situation.
31456	Q  George, when did the President know that they were going to use tear gas?
31457	Was it before the assault on the compound?
31458	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I just don't know.
31459	I don't believe he was given a lot of detail on exactly how the operation would go.
31460	What time did she call?
31461	Was there a gap between when she called him?
31462	I mean, was he at dinner when she called and --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no, no.
31463	I think he called her last night.
31464	I couldn't swear to it, but I believe he called her last night.
31465	He just wanted to talk to her.
31466	Q     what was going on?
31467	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of, no.
31468	Q  What do you know about the situation now?
31469	Everyone has perished who -- except eight or nine?
31470	And do you know any of the other details?
31471	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know any more details than the FBI reported in Waco.
31472	Q     watching CNN or how was he keeping track of what is going on?
31473	If he wasn't talking to his Attorney General, how was he keeping track of what was going on here?
31474	I mean, with all due respect to CNN, is that how he was doing it?
31475	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.
31476	Q  Who were those contacts?
31477	I mean, was it Mack McLarty, Webb Hubbell?
31478	How was the President being kept informed?
31479	That's not a --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe Mack was in contact with Webb.
31480	I spoke with several people at the Justice Department.
31481	I believe Bruce Lindsey spoke with people at the Justice Department.
31482	We were fully briefed and fully informed.
31483	Do you know if that's true or not?
31484	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think there's a chance he may have.
31485	I don't believe he did, but I think there's certainly a chance that he may have at some point.
31486	I don't believe he did.
31487	Q  George, who decided that the briefing would be done by the Attorney General?
31488	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The Attorney General.
31489	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.
31490	We were told about it.
31491	Q  Did you ask her to go on Nightline and MacNeil-Lehrer and all that stuff?
31492	Was that part of --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.
31493	Q     there was no advice from the White House at all about her -- she was on all night, all day.
31494	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes, and she did a very good job.
31495	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, that wasn't the intent at all.
31496	As I said, we had to -- we wanted to wait until we had all of the information at hand.
31497	The President is also making a statement today.
31498	The President made a statement yesterday morning.
31499	Q  After the --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Number two -- well, the first.
31500	And he gave one yesterday and he's giving one today.
31501	It was the President wants to put out a written statement?
31502	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, he did personally do so.
31503	That is his statement.
31504	It's a statement under his name.
31505	Q  No, what you said was --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's just not right, Susan.
31506	Q  Took responsibility -- all right.
31507	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Check the transcript.
31508	Q  It's stretching it a little bit where the kids are concerned, though, isn't it, George?
31509	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that that is an entirely different matter.
31510	But he clearly was intent on creating some kind of an apocalyptic incident, and that's what he did.
31511	Q  You're still operating completely on assumption, right?
31512	I mean, you have no evidence, or you know of no evidence that this was mass suicide.
31513	Q  I didn't quite hear it.
31514	This might be Ann's question, I didn't quite hear it.
31515	But at what time did Clinton himself put out a statement on this?
31516	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, right when we had all the information.
31517	We were working on it.
31518	But it will be run by the Treasury and Justice.
31519	And who else in the White House sat in on that meeting?
31520	Anyone else from Justice?
31521	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't believe anybody else was there at the time.
31522	It was a phone call on Monday, it wasn't a meeting.
31523	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Sunday.
31524	It was a phone call, it wasn't a meeting.
31525	What did he think she was talking about?
31526	If he didn't know about tear gas, what exactly was his idea of what he was approving?
31527	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.
31528	I mean --          Q  What information did he have in terms of how this would proceed?
31529	Q  It's hard to imagine him not asking, though.
31530	Can you take that question and --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely.
31531	Q     get the answer and come back to us with all of it?
31532	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
31533	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Never.
31534	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not once.
31535	Q  She had no guidance from the White House at all?
31536	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We certainly didn't object.
31537	Q  But did you -- (laughter) -- no, I'm sure you didn't object, but did you suggest it?
31538	Was this a plan --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.
31539	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.
31540	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.
31541	Q  Did she notify you?
31542	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We certainly knew about it.
31543	It seemed like a good decision.
31544	It was a good decision.
31545	Q  Let me ask it this way, George, if in hindsight how you would handle it?
31546	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was handled very well.
31547	Q  You wouldn't change a thing if --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Change what?
31548	Q  The way the White House handled any part of it -- from start to finish.
31549	It's just very reminiscent of what you guys did during the campaign.
31550	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  How so?
31551	Yesterday there was a law enforcement incident.
31552	The incident ended in tragic deaths of many, many people.
31553	The Attorney General was involved in that decision.
31554	The Attorney General made the decision to do that.
31555	In other words, she came and she said, I'm going to put pressure on them.
31556	It's hard not to see Clinton, who's fairly intelligent and inquisitive, asking how.
31557	I don't have a minute-by-minute account of the conversation.
31558	Q  How long a conversation?
31559	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was about 15 minutes.
31560	Q  Telephone conversation?
31561	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
31562	Does the President not accept the fact that as Commander-In-Chief, it is ultimately his decision?
31563	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know what this has to do with Commander-In-Chief.
31564	This was a law enforcement action, not a military action.
31565	I mean, I think there's just no ambiguity about that.
31566	Q  But is he accepting it as his decision as well as hers, or is he saying it's her decision?
31567	There's a difference.
31568	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As a matter of fact, it was her decision.
31569	He did not object to that decision.
31570	He clearly takes full responsibility.
31571	What exactly did they spend 15 minutes talking about if it was just very general?
31572	That's a long period of time in a phone conversation.
31573	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It is an awful long phone conversation.
31574	It was a very important phone conversation.
31575	I think Brit has asked that we take the question, and I've said that I would.
31576	Q  One of the things Reno said last night is that the buck stops here.
31577	I think that was her direct quotation.
31578	Does the President agree with that in this case?
31579	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President says he accepts full responsibility.
31580	And she's not shrinking from that at all, but neither is the President.
31581	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not to my knowledge.
31582	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.
31583	And I don't want to cast any questions about the motives of those who are requesting investigation.
31584	We want an investigation, and we'll have a full and complete investigation.
31585	Q  In what forum will you answer Brit's question?
31586	Will you put out a written statement?
31587	Will you -- the wires?
31588	How will you answer the question that you've taken?
31589	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm just not sure.
31590	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'll have to try and remember.
31591	He had a series of meetings with different members of the staff during the afternoon.
31592	He was certainly monitoring the situation in Waco and getting periodic reports on that as well.
31593	He did see some on CNN as well.
31594	I believe he saw a fair amount of the FBI press briefing as well.
31595	Q  And those reports would have come to him from Mack McLarty, would they -- do you think?
31596	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Mack talked to him, Bruce talked to him, I talked to him.
31597	Did he say, I don't know why you felt the need to say that?
31598	I'm here to reassure you that you don't have to do this?
31599	Did that come up at all?
31600	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if it even came up that specifically.
31601	Q  And her response was, if the President wants me to, I will.
31602	I mean, it's a conditional statement.
31603	And this just didn't come up.
31604	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Certainly.
31605	Q  George, for the record, does the President want her to resign?
31606	I know Dee Dee answered this morning --          MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Absolutely not.
31607	He supports Janet Reno.
31608	She's a good Attorney General.
31609	She's done a good job.
31610	She handled a difficult situation extremely well.
31611	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.
31612	And the President is not second-guessing that decision and those recommendations in any way.
31613	That is not to say that he doesn't regret the loss of life.
31614	Everybody regrets the loss of life in this situation.
31615	But the best judgments were made in a difficult situation based on the best information we had.
31616	Q  George, the 15-minute conversation was the one on Sunday, is that correct?
31617	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Yes.
31618	Q  How long was the one at 11:00 a.m. yesterday morning?
31619	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.
31620	I'll take that question, too.
31621	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You'd have to ask them.
31622	I know that there were several experts.
31623	Q  And also, why weren't there replacements for these people?
31624	Is the unit that small?
31625	MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I think it is a very small highly-specialized unit.
31626	But I think it's one of the kinds of things that the investigation will examine.
31627	Q  George, isn't there a factor here involving the FBI Director?
31628	Normally, a president, when he wants to get information, doesn't only asks the Attorney General.
31629	I know the chain of command.
31630	But presidents talk to their FBI directors.

32651	On whatra> exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call "orthodox?"
32652	"Orthodox" is a compound word.
32653	It comes from 'orthos' (straight, true,      right) and from 'doxa' (opinion, doctrine, teaching).
32654	I use orthodox to      refer to 'right teaching.'
32655	Right teaching is derived from letting God      speak to us through the Bible.
32656	I think that it is apparent from reading the Scriptures that are     pertinent.
32657	But was it not until later that Christ rose from the dead     and ascended to heaven?
32658	The     answer lies in the location of "paradise" when Jesus died.
32659	Apparently paradise was not exalted to heaven until Easter Day.
32660	Verse 10 adds: "He who descended is the same     as He who ascended above all the heavens."
32661	I think that this characterization is faulty.
32662	Whenever my 'personal      interpretation' is questioned, I usually give a reason.
32663	Put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can      have a discussion on that topic.

32813	In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of           MATTER, NOT anti-matter.
32814	Larson TOTALLY REJECTED "General Relativity" as another           MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.
32815	The one           dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.
32816	[Larson often used the term "COORDINATE TIME" when writing           about this.]
32817	But the formula for acceleration is           ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).
32818	Orthodox physicists           are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.

32823	There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to           stop it!
32824	First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate           energy by "fusion".
32825	A small fraction comes from slow           gravitational collapse.

32919	Check the history books as well.
32920	Compare someone else'sinterpretation with your own.
32921	Then make a judgment.
32922	It doesn't take a theologian to understand what is being said.
32923	The Bible is a bunch of testimonies from people like you and I addressed to people like you and I.
32924	These guys wrote down what they saw and heard.
32925	Is it their open diary--and they want to tell you something.
32926	And because theywant you to know something, they make it very clear what they want you toknow.

32949	Several specificcases  have already been cited.
32950	And again with this new statement, you show more irrationality with regards to heaven.
32951	Jesus does tell you something of what to expectin heaven.
32952	Jesus expects you to use your brain to believe in him.
32953	Jesus doesnot expect you to placate either.

33789	Ancient astronomers observed points oflight that appeared to move among the stars.
33790	But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age ofsolar system exploration.
33791	The United States has sent automated spacecraft, thenhuman-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon.
33792	These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge andunderstanding of the solar system.
33793	Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraftinstruments and systems.
33794	Rechargeable batteries are employed forbackup and supplemental power.
33795	To helpprevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used tocontrol spacecraft.
33796	The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain aconstant gaze at selected stars.
33797	Their flights helped shape the planning of latermissions.
33798	All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary powersource.
33799	The first and the final versions of the spacecraft hadtwo wings covered with photovoltaic cells.
33800	Other Mariners wereequipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonalbodies.
33801	The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carriedfour probes that were dropped through the clouds.
33802	The Sun     A discussion of the objects in the solar system must startwith the Sun.
33803	This 0.14 percent represents thematerial left over from the Sun's formation.
33804	As a star, the Sun generates energy through the process offusion.
33805	It may take a trillionyears to cool off completely.
33806	We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is.
33807	Ifit were different in almost any way, life would almost certainlynever have developed on Earth.
33808	Until Mariner 10, little was known about Mercury.
33809	The planet is so close to theSun that it is usually lost in solar glare.
33810	The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing theplanet.
33811	The cliffs are ashigh as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310miles).
33812	Mercuryliterally bakes and freezes at the same time.
33813	Days and nights are long on Mercury.
33814	Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock likethat of Earth.
33815	Mariner 5, launched in June 1967, flew muchcloser to the planet.
33816	However,spacecraft have discovered significant differences as well.
33817	Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus' atmosphere (95 times asdense as Earth's) is carbon dioxide.
33818	The principal constituent ofEarth's atmosphere is nitrogen.
33819	The spacecraft usesradar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution imagesof the surface.
33820	Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanicfeatures, faults and impact craters.
33821	An elevated region named IshtarTerra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States.
33822	Atone end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, a mountain the sizeof Mount Everest.
33823	Venus' atmosphere serves as a simplifiedlaboratory for the study of our weather.
33824	From our journeys into space, we have learned much about ourhome planet.
33825	We've learned that the magnetic field doesnot fade off into space but has definite boundaries.
33826	Thesewatchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms.
33827	The Moon     The Moon is Earth's single natural satellite.
33828	NASA's Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materialsand data.
33829	Thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by theApollo crews will remain sharp and clear.
33830	The origin of the Moon is still a mystery.
33831	Wells, enough people believedin the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.
33832	Photossent back from the Chryse Planitia ("Plains of Gold") showed ableak, rusty-red landscape.
33833	Fine red dust from the martian soil givesthe sky a salmon hue.
33834	The results sent back by the laboratory on each VikingLander were inconclusive.
33835	Is there life on Mars?
33836	No one knows for sure, but theViking mission found no evidence that organic molecules existthere.
33837	Few weather changes were observed.
33838	The martian atmosphere, like that of Venus, is primarilycarbon dioxide.
33839	Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in smallpercentages.
33840	Local patches of early morningfog can form in valleys.
33841	Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos.
33842	They are small andirregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces.
33843	Viking Orbiter 1 quit onAugust 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas wasused up.
33844	Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13, 1983.
33845	These objects are known asasteroids or minor planets.
33846	Most, but not all, are found in aband or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
33847	Asteroids are material left over from the formation of thesolar system.
33848	Morelikely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into aplanet.
33849	Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth.
33850	Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth arecalled meteoroids.
33851	One of the best placesto look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.
33852	Stonymeteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very muchlike terrestrial rocks.
33853	Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroidsfor closer examination.
33854	Jupiterwas the first port of call.
33855	Pioneer 11 followed a year later.
33856	Ammonia icecrystals form white Jovian clouds.
33857	The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries throughtelescopes on Earth.
33858	This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter'satmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet.
33859	The Great Red Spot might be amillion years old.
33860	Voyager 1 returnedthe first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter.
33861	Themassive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journeyaround the Sun.
33862	With 16 known moons, Jupiter is something of aminiature solar system.
33863	A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is underway.
33864	For the firsttime, humans had seen the moons of another world.
33865	Europa, approximately the same size as our Moon, is thebrightest Galilean satellite.
33866	The moon's surface displays acomplex array of streaks, indicating the crust has beenfractured.
33867	This ocean is coveredby an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to thecold of space.
33868	Europa's core is made of rock that sank to itscenter.
33869	Like Europa, the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede andCallisto -- are worlds of ice and rock.
33870	Ganymede is the largestsatellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercuryand Pluto.
33871	The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water orice and the rest rock.
33872	Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will beperformed by the Galileo Orbiter.
33873	Saturn     No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn.
33874	Itsexquisite ring system is unrivaled.
33875	Like Jupiter, Saturn iscomposed mostly of hydrogen.
33876	Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn.
33877	Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons inAugust 1981.
33878	The rings arebright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.
33879	The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing bodyventured too close to Saturn.
33880	Thesecomplex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringletsthat make up the major rings.
33881	As they had atJupiter, the Voyagers saw a version of Earth's auroras nearSaturn's poles.
33882	The Voyagers discovered new moons and found severalsatellites that share the same orbit.
33883	Saturn's 18th moon was discovered in 1990 fromimages taken by Voyager 2 in 1981.
33884	The lattercompound is a building block of amino acids.
33885	The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassinimission.
33886	Uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of thesolar system.
33887	During Voyager 2's flyby, the south polefaced the Sun.
33888	The planet's blue color occurs because methane in itsatmosphere absorbs all other colors.
33889	Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105miles) in diameter, orbiting Uranus.
33890	The most remarkable of Uranus' moons is Miranda.
33891	Its surfacefeatures high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains andwinding valleys.
33892	Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged11.
33893	Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot, a circular storm thesize of Earth, in Neptune's atmosphere.
33894	The highest wind speeds of anyplanet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) perhour.
33895	The planet's corecontains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of theother gas giants.
33896	Neptune's distinctive blue appearance, likeUranus' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.
33897	Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in1846 and Nereid in 1949.
33898	Voyager 2 found six more.
33899	Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under sixdays.
33900	Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowlytowards the planet.
33901	Triton's landscape is as strange and unexpected as those ofIo and Miranda.
33902	The moon has more rock than its counterparts atSaturn and Uranus.
33903	Dark streaks appear on the ice cap.
33904	Triton might be more like Pluto than any otherobject spacecraft have so far visited.
33905	Discovered in 1930, Pluto appears to be little more than acelestial snowball.
33906	Observations also show that Pluto's spinaxis is tipped by 122 degrees.
33907	The planet has one known satellite, Charon, discovered in1978.
33908	Pluto'sand Charon's rotational period and Charon's period of revolutionare all 6.4 Earth days.
33909	Comets     The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay avisit to the inner planets.
33910	The coma grows as the comet gets closer to theSun.
33911	Comets --from the Latin cometa, meaning "long-haired" -- are essentiallydramatic light shows.
33912	His namebecame part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the cometreturned on schedule.
33913	Unfortunately, Sir Edmond did not live tosee it.
33914	A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passescomparatively close to Earth.
33915	But since 1959,spaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on ourneighbors in space.
33916	We are lucky to be alive now to see these strangeand beautiful places and objects.
33917	We are also gaining insight into Earth's complex weathersystems.
33918	We will continue to learn and benefit as our automatedspacecraft explore our neighborhood in space.
33919	Futuremissions are planned for Mars, Saturn, a comet and the asteroidbelt.
33920	We can also look forward to the time when humans will onceagain set foot on an alien world.

33950	The conservative approach expects tofind specific behavioral rules.

34721	Something like 4 turbos>>>and mucho macho HP.
34722	One cool price too, as i heard.
34723	It's labeled a Bugatti but has nothing to do with >>the Bugatti's of yore, from what I understand.
34724	At least the Bugatti EB110 has compound curves comparedto the slab sides on the Consulier.
34725	And the Bugatti has a quad turbo V-12(thing of it as 4 three cylinder turbo engines tied together).
34726	Also EttoreBugatti's nephew is on the board of directors and had a hand in thedevelopment.
34727	So that's about as much Bugatti as you are likely to get intoday's world.
34728	I have motorcylclist friends who say the same about `cages'.

34735	"Just maybe you won't be home.
34736	"I just get laid off, and my divorce became final.
34737	But I just wasn't ready for what happened this particular Monday."
34738	When Lawmaster drove into the driveway that bleak afternoon, one of his neighbors had some news.
34739	"'Ohmigod, John, you are in big trouble!'
34740	my neighbor tells me.
34741	I couldn't believe it.
34742	Then I walked inside.
34743	It was no nightmare; it was horribly real life.
34744	The doors were closed but not latched, much less locked.
34745	The ammo and guns were left unsecured.
34746	"My front and back doors were pulled shut, but they were busted through and couldn't latch.
34747	Anybody could have waltzed in there and stolen everything I own.
34748	A child could have taken a gun.
34749	The guns, the safe -- everything was open and laying around.
34750	I keep all my magazines empty, but someone had loaded them.
34751	They said they were told to shut things down.
34752	Then I found the note.
34753	"Nothing Found - ATF."
34754	"They didn't make any attempt to notify me.
34755	I've lived in Tulsa all my life and never got more than a traffic ticket.
34756	They didn't leave someone here to watch over my private property.
34757	They didn't even come by to explain what happened.
34758	They just raided my home, ransaked it, left it wide open and left."
34759	Lawmaster placed a phone call to the local BATF agent.
34760	"I asked, 'Are you gonna' arrest me?'
34761	I asken him, "Who is going to repair and clean up my house?'
34762	And he said, "If you're going to talk to me, come down to my office.'
34763	"'I can't come down!'
34764	'My doors are broken!'
34765	If I had been on vacation and I didn't have friendly neighbors, I would have lost everything I own.
34766	"'Oh, I'll come right down, alright,' I told him.
34767	'I'll come down, but I'll bring my attorney.'
34768	And he said, 'Well, you bring your attorney, and we won't talk to you.
34769	"You and I have two different concepts of "free."
